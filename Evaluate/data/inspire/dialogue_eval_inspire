["<|endoftext|> Hi There! What types of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> Hello! I'm more of an action movie or a good romance and mystery movie. <|endoftext|> I just saw the trailer for Knives Out when I went to see Joker and it looked like a good mix of action and mystery! <|endoftext|> I seen that one too as I seen Joker about a month ago. I thought about asking my fiance about going and seeing it. <|endoftext|> It looks like a good movie for people who like many different movies. It also has a great cast! I was surprised to see Chris Evans in the trailer! <|endoftext|> Maybe with Chris Evans in it it'll be easier to convince my fiance to see it. Do you know who else is in the cast? <|endoftext|> Daniel Craig and Jamie Lee Curtis are also in the cast. Daniel Craig does a lot of 007 so definitely a good hearthrob role to convince the misses lol! <|endoftext|> I am the misses lol. But he loves the bond movies so that should be a good incentive for him to go see it. Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> The new Star Wars comes out in less than a month, if you are into the franchise. <|endoftext|> He is, I think he told me we're getting it when it comes out to add to our movie collection. <|endoftext|> Well that is another great action movie. I also recommend the John Wick series <|endoftext|> I haven't seen any of that series. Could you tell me what the general plot is> <|endoftext|> John Wick is a former member of a gang, he was basically an assassin. He falls in love and quits the game, but then his wife dies, and someone comes in and kills his dog. He then goes on a revenge rampage against the people who broke into his house. I have yet to watch the 3rd one but the action scenes were really cool! <|endoftext|> Oh I'd definitely would cry at the dogs death. <|endoftext|> It is really sad! the dog was a last gift from his dying wife which makes it so much worse <|endoftext|> I couldn't even finish I am legend because of the dog dying. Anything with animal death makes me ball like a baby. <|endoftext|> Marley & Me had me crying for a good half hour so I completely understand that! <|endoftext|> I avoided that movie because someone told me he passed away. My fiance took me to see jurrasic world as our first date and I cried at the dinosuars dying. <|endoftext|> I would definitely avoid that movie if animal deaths make you said. Oh that is so cute though! <|endoftext|> Yeah, he had to calm me down for about an hour and bought me ice cream to apologize for it. <|endoftext|> Aww that is so sweet. Given that you dont want to see animals die, and you are looking for an Action/Mystery I think Knives Out would be a good movie choice. Do you agree? <|endoftext|> I do agree with that. When it comes out i'll bring it up for date night. Thank you!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How's it going today <|endoftext|> Good how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm good!

Do you like the Terminator films? <|endoftext|> It's been a long time since I saw one. Refresh me on the plot <|endoftext|> It's about a robot assassin who travels back from the future to kill a woman because she is to bear the a son that will lead against the robot army <|endoftext|> Wow, tell me more <|endoftext|> Do you like futuristic sci-fi movies? <|endoftext|> I love back to the Future <|endoftext|> You would love Terminator! I highly recommend you check it out <|endoftext|> Who is in it? <|endoftext|> It's Arnold Schwarzenegger! <|endoftext|> Did they make a new Terminator? <|endoftext|> Yes there is a new Terminator movie.

Comedy, romance, thrillers? <|endoftext|> Comedy is my favorite. <|endoftext|> Perfect, what is the latest comedy that you saw? <|endoftext|> The last comedy I saw was Christmas Vacation. <|endoftext|> Nice, have you seen Grown Ups, the original or number two? <|endoftext|> Yes I have seen and love both! <|endoftext|> How about Good Boys or Night School? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen either. I've heard about Night School but I don't recall Good Boys. What is that about? <|endoftext|> Kids that skip school and have a chaotic day. Yeah, Night School is my favorite and I totally recommend that you watch that! <|endoftext|> Since you like it so much, I'll have to check out Night School. <|endoftext|> Have you watched the trailer before or seen anything about it? <|endoftext|> I think I saw a commercial for it on TV. It has Kevin Hart in it right? <|endoftext|> Yes he's the main character. It makes the movie so much more funny <|endoftext|> Thank you for the suggestion! <|endoftext|> Not a problem.

Do you have any thriller or horror recommendations? <|endoftext|> i recently watched one scifi thriller <|endoftext|> What was the name of it? <|endoftext|> movie: paycheck.. its based on predicting future with technology <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of that one. Do you have another to recommend? <|endoftext|> Gemini man is good <|endoftext|> Ahh with Will Smith. I'll have to check it out. <|endoftext|> it was good <|endoftext|> Great! I accept this recommendation <|endoftext|> perfect.. enjoy the movie <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> i dont want to give spoilers on this.. you will definitely enjoy the movie <|endoftext|> You can give a tiny one lol <|endoftext|> cloning and hitman related story <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> hi. can you recommend a scary movie? <|endoftext|> do u like them gory? or not so much blood? <|endoftext|> not necessarily gory, but supernatural is good. <|endoftext|> crawl was awesome, but if you like supernatural recommend the last exorcism <|endoftext|> are those older movies or new? the last exorcism is that new? <|endoftext|> it's a little old but you would definitely love paranormal activity if you are looking for something paranormal <|endoftext|> i have seen paranormal activity. Enjoyed it. What is crawl about? <|endoftext|> It takes place in florida, big hurricane hits houses near swamp and they become infested with man eating aligators <|endoftext|> sounds interesting. do you know anything more recent? <|endoftext|> IT2 havent seen but they said it was great. did u see the first one? <|endoftext|> Yes, I saw the first one. Would like to see the 2nd but do not know if it's still in theaters or streaming. <|endoftext|> big fan of all the pitch black movies with vin diesel <|endoftext|> i have never heard of those. what are those about? how many of them are there? <|endoftext|> it's 3 movies. Pitch Black, Chronicles of riddick and Riddick. They are awesome action / scary <|endoftext|> ive heard of the riddick movies. did not know they were related to pitch black. i think i'll try and watch those. <|endoftext|> Any scary movies that you can recommend <|endoftext|> I'm a big Stephen King fan, so any of his. The shining is my favorite. Also Gerald's Game. <|endoftext|> sounds old school anyting modern? <|endoftext|> his newest one Dr Sleep is out now, but i haven't seen it yet. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> hello. Do you have a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> Do you have a preference for movies? <|endoftext|> I usually like gangster movies, action movies and dramas. <|endoftext|> Are you interested in the new top gun movie? <|endoftext|> No not really. I thought the first one was ok but not really up my alley. <|endoftext|> What action movies do you like? <|endoftext|> lets see...I liked die hard, the avengers, john wick, highlander. Those kinds of movies. I also liked goodfellas, casino, the godfather <|endoftext|> I was never into the mob type movies, but I do like some action movies. Do you like movies that are inspired by true stories? <|endoftext|> Yes. I find it fascinating that farfetched things can happen to people and be made into movies. <|endoftext|> I think I can find some trailers that might be good for that type of genre. <|endoftext|> what recommendations do you have? <|endoftext|> Ford vs Ferrari and Dark Waters <|endoftext|> I accept watching the trailer for Dark Waters. <|endoftext|> It looks like a good movie, I find it pretty interesting. <|endoftext|> What is the premise of the movie? I saw the trailer for For v Ferrari. <|endoftext|> It's about an environmental lawsuit against a company for polluting the waters that people drink. <|endoftext|> That seems interesting I wonder if there are any murders in there. Do you know? <|endoftext|> I don't know if there are any murders. I do think some people died as a result of the company. <|endoftext|> Thank you. I accept that recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there. How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. I was wondering if you had any movie recommendations. <|endoftext|> Let me see. Well, what kind of movies do you usually find yourself watching? What do you like? <|endoftext|> I tend to like action movies that also involve comedy. <|endoftext|> Oh, me too. So, what did you see last that you liked? <|endoftext|> I really liked Avengers: Endgame because I liked the pacing and the effects were great. <|endoftext|> Okay, I think I kind of understand your taste a little. It's sort of similar to mine, although I haven't seen an action hero movie in a while. Did you like Guardians of the Galaxy? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't, but I heard good things about it. <|endoftext|> Oh, I was assuming that you'd seen it. I saw that with my son and I was surprised at how much I liked it. <|endoftext|> Were you able to see the sequel for it? <|endoftext|> No, but I would like to. I would really recommend that. I don't know if you know who Chris Pratt is, but he's a keeper. He was on Parks & Rec, the comedy show. <|endoftext|> I love Chris Pratt! I accept your recommendation. Thank you so much. <|endoftext|> :) oh, I'm so happy. Cool. I hope you like it. <|endoftext|> Do you have any other recommendations for action movies? <|endoftext|> Hmmm...I don't know if I can think of any  others that are funny like that. I know there are some though. <|endoftext|> Oh, I just remembered. I really liked Deadpool because it did a great job of mashing comedy and action together. <|endoftext|> My 20 year old son liked that. I have only seen a couple parts. You've no doubt seen the MIB series, but those were kind of good as well. <|endoftext|> Can you tell me what you like about MIB? I like Will Smith, but I haven't see any of the movies. <|endoftext|> Oh, yeah. They're telling us to quit the hit, but real quick. He's funny and creative in it and he's great when paired with Tommy Lee Jones. It's just creative and makes you laugh unexpectedly. Anyway, that's all I got. It was nice talking to you. <|endoftext|> It was great talking to you. I'll be sure to check out your recommendations. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I hope I can find a movie you would really like to see. <|endoftext|> What movie do you recommend? <|endoftext|> I have some good recommendations but I was wondering what genre you like enjoy the most? <|endoftext|> I like thrillers and comedy mostly, and things with a good cinematography, though i Gotta be in the mood for it <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Hustlers yet? It is a little bit of a mix of comedy, drama and thriller. <|endoftext|> No I haven't, what's it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a group of former strippers who work together to turn the tables on their wall street clients <|endoftext|> Ahhhh interesting, is it like a laugh-out-loud comedy, or like a quiet chuckle? <|endoftext|> A lot of it is laugh out loud, but it is also a make you want to see what happens next kind of movie. <|endoftext|> Who stars in it? <|endoftext|> Jennifer Lopez, Julia Stiles and Constance Wu <|endoftext|> Well, I could probably get into that, I liked Jennifer Lopez in Enough <|endoftext|> Yeah, I think this is one of her better movies. <|endoftext|> My wife is actually right here, she said she wanted to watch your movie actually, so her and I are both going to watch it haha <|endoftext|> I think you will both enjoy it! There is another movie I am thinking of that is more of a thriller, it is called Gemini man <|endoftext|> What's that about? And who's in it? <|endoftext|> It stars Will Smith and it is about a hit man who is being targeted for hit by a younger version of himself! It is very exciting! <|endoftext|> Ooph I like Will Smith a lot too, not always the best guy for serious roles though, is it better than his last few serious movies? <|endoftext|> I think he has come a long way in this one, it is definitely worth watching <|endoftext|> If it's like Enemy of the State or I Am Legend I'll probably give it a watch, if it's like Hancock or that one After Earth I'll probably pass <|endoftext|> It's really more like Enemy of the State, actually in Gemini Man he is being targeted by the government as well <|endoftext|> Of course, always the government! But I'll be watching that one too now, thanks to you! <|endoftext|> Glad I could help, I hope you and your wife both enjoy! <|endoftext|> Thank you for the recommendations, I'm sure we'll like them both! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Well, hello there! <|endoftext|> Have you watched any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> I like to think so. I'm a big fan of older stuff. I just watched the equalizer yesterday. Have you ever seen it? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen it. Is it an action movie? I love movies that are action packed. <|endoftext|> Yeah I'd say it is! Are you a fan of Denzel Washington? <|endoftext|> Yes, I love Denzel Washington. He's a great actor. <|endoftext|> haha I'm glad to hear it. Sometimes I feel like the younger generations aren't going to get actors like that. You know what I mean? <|endoftext|> Yeah< i understand. My favorite movie of Denzel's is The Pelican Brief. My favorite movie genre is sci-fi. Have you seen any good sci-fi movies you would recommend? <|endoftext|> Oh definitely. Do you like to be scared when you watch movies, or just like the action? <|endoftext|> To an extent I'm not really into movies with spirits or ones that are really gory but I like a good scare every now and then. <|endoftext|> Okay, I think I know what movie to recommend to you friend! <|endoftext|> What's it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a regime in the future who is arresting people before they actually commit their crimes. Then one of the leaders, is actually found guilty. Lot's of action, sci-fi, but has no real gore. Biggest thing to me is, they aren't just shooting people. It actually has a good story! <|endoftext|> Sounds awesome! What's the name of the movie? <|endoftext|> Well, I'd like to ask you two more questions, just to make sure it's the right one. Is that okay? <|endoftext|> Yes, ask away <|endoftext|> Does a movie being mainstream bother you at all <|endoftext|> Not at all. I enjoy all kinds of movies and don't mind a movie done soley for the bottom line. <|endoftext|> I like your style. Final question: Would you rather swim with sharks and not have a cage around you, or jump into the lion exhibit at the zoo for 8 minutes? <|endoftext|> Hard choice but I guess I'd have to choose to swim with sharks. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello I am looking for a movie trailer to decide if I want to see the movie. Can you assist? <|endoftext|> Actually I was looking for a movie. Can you assist me by any chance? <|endoftext|> will do my best..do you like tom hanks? <|endoftext|> I like Tom Hanks a lot. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie of his did you see? <|endoftext|> Its been a while but I did see The Post. I think it came out last year <|endoftext|> Seems I recall that one, how about Forrest Gump <|endoftext|> I loved Forest Gump. That was a true classic and it never gets old. <|endoftext|> Were you deeply moved by saving private ryan as i was? <|endoftext|> Yes. That was a great movie and I enjoyed watching it from start to finish. <|endoftext|> The opening scene was so realistic I was horrified, <|endoftext|> It was really graphic and I was kind of surprised. <|endoftext|> did it seem realistic to you so much you felt the fear? <|endoftext|> I did felt that at the start of the movie. <|endoftext|> who was your favorite character? <|endoftext|> Captain Miller. Which movie do you recommend for me now with Tom Hanks <|endoftext|> Check the DaVinci Code <|endoftext|> I didn't like that movie. Do you have another movie with Tom Hanks that came out this year? <|endoftext|> Cast <|endoftext|> I never heard of it. <|endoftext|> This year hmmm he makes so many <|endoftext|> How about the movie that he plays Mr. Rodgers. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! For sure I would like to see that! <|endoftext|> I believe its called It's a beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you? <|endoftext|> I am looking for something to watch, preferably action, comedy, or thriller if it is not too scary. <|endoftext|> Horror films always scare me too. What kind of action and comedy movies do you like? Are you into action movies with explosions or adventure? And are you into rom/com's or more traditional comedy? <|endoftext|> My Best Friends Wedding, Green Book, Die Hard, Shawshank Redemption <|endoftext|> Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies! Have you ever seen any of the Fast and Furios movies? They have a spin-off that came out this year called Hobbs and Shaw. Also, there is a new John Wick if you're looking for action movies similar to Die Hard. <|endoftext|> I have seen The Rock discussing it on some talk show a few weeks back. I don't know the franchise enough to know the storyline but I loved the fast and the furious. <|endoftext|> The spin-off is pretty loosely based off of the main movies so you could watch it and still be able to follow since it's mostly about fast cars and general action movie elements. What kind of comedy movies do you like besides My Best Friends Wedding? Are you into satire, anything animated? <|endoftext|> I usually don't do traditional comedy but I have to say I LOVED  Old School.! Will Ferrell is one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> Old School was so funny! Will Ferrell is hilarious have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2? <|endoftext|> My niece was JUST talking about that yesterday. She showed me a clip real quick and I am definitely going to check it out. Great choice, any other suggestions? <|endoftext|> Hmm as far as thriller, have you seen Bird Box? That one seemed to have a lot of hype. It was not too scary but had a good amount of jump scares without the gore <|endoftext|> I think I have heard of it but don't know the story. Based on what you said that would be a no. I am thinking more Mission Impossible or Money Train. <|endoftext|> Well speaking of Mission Impossible, there is a new one that recently came out last year and Jack Reacher is also a good alternative also starring Tom Cruise <|endoftext|> That sounds cool. What is that about? <|endoftext|> It's about an army vet that investigates the mass killing of 5 random people in the same town by a sniper who has a weird history with him. It's one of those action movies where there are a lot of plot twists <|endoftext|> Definitely sounds cool. I will definitely take a look <|endoftext|> Sounds great! You've got two great movies to check out is there any other movie genre you want recommendations on? Or any movie you really like and want to watch something similar? <|endoftext|> I would love to see a remake or something similar to Notting Hill. Julia Roberts fan as well. <|endoftext|> I love movies like that! The first thing that comes to mind is Maid in Manhattan have you seen that before? it's not Julia Roberts but its a pretty similar storyline <|endoftext|> I have seen it, Jennifer Lopez is awesome too. Critics do not give her enough credit. What is that new movie coming out of hers? The one where she is a stripper? <|endoftext|> I just watched that yesterday! Hustlers its a really good movie I would recommend it. I agree they dont give her enough credit <|endoftext|> That's It! I definitely want to see that! Is it still in theaters? <|endoftext|> It's unfortunately not still in theaters but you can probably watch it on YouTube or it will probably be on DVD soon. Do you want to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do. Thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> What's your favorite genre to watch lately? <|endoftext|> i like pop music <|endoftext|> Cheeky <|endoftext|> the pop music feel like good <|endoftext|> I'd recommend dancer in the dark then. It's a friendly musical starring Bjork. <|endoftext|> are you recommend me <|endoftext|> It's honestly not bad if you like Lars Von Trier movies. <|endoftext|> i like the sci fi movies <|endoftext|> How do you feel about Scarlett Johansson? Under the skin is a pretty eerie sci fi movie. <|endoftext|> sounds is good <|endoftext|> I'd say so. <|endoftext|> yes i like to watch <|endoftext|> Sounds like watching? <|endoftext|> yes i like too <|endoftext|> Scarjo gets nay nay. <|endoftext|> its a web series on amazon <|endoftext|> Ron and Fez or Opie and Anthony? <|endoftext|> what is this movie ? <|endoftext|> A mysterious young woman seduces lonely men in the evening hours in Scotland. However, events lead her to begin a process of self-discovery. <|endoftext|> yes i like to watch this movie <|endoftext|> Under the skin. <|endoftext|> no Ron and Fez or Opie and Anthony <|endoftext|> I'd say Opie and Anthony has better guests, but Ronnie B is a good egg. <|endoftext|> but i think watch both movie what would you say? <|endoftext|> Anthony's voice was featured in a couple of the Grand Theft Auto games. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! Are you looking for a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, i am do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I would like to see trailers for action movies. <|endoftext|> I love action movies! What action movies have you watched recently? <|endoftext|> I recently watched John Wick 3, very good movie, in my opinion and fully action packed. <|endoftext|> Yes, it is a great movie! I watched it with my friend when it came out in theaters! Are you interested in a similar movie? <|endoftext|> Yes i would be interested in a similar movie, with good actors and a good plot. <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Matrix? Keanu Reeves the actor is also the star in this movie <|endoftext|> Yes, I have watched the first three, very awesome collection of movies. Is there i new one? <|endoftext|> No, the fourth one will not be released until 2022 unfortunately <|endoftext|> How about the new Rambo? <|endoftext|> I have not watched it yet, but it has some low ratings. Have you seen The Equalizer? <|endoftext|> Yes i have,i hear there is a new Terminator coming out soon, is this correct? <|endoftext|> Terminator: Dark Fate? It is currently out in theaters <|endoftext|> I haven't seen a trailer for it. <|endoftext|> Because of your interest in action movies, I think it would be a good fit for you. Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes,i would like to watch this movie trailer, Thank you <|endoftext|> Glad to help! <|endoftext|> Thanks again for your help. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Thank you...do you have a recommendation? <|endoftext|> First, what are your movie interests? <|endoftext|> I like many movie genres, like romance, comedies, suspense, and thrillers. <|endoftext|> I was really impressed with Joker, The Irishman, or for something a little lighter I recommend Toy Story 4. <|endoftext|> I've been wanting to see the Joker but haven't yet. <|endoftext|> It is a really interesting movie and Joaquin Phoenix rendition of the Joker is very captivating. <|endoftext|> That's what I heard, I really enjoyed Heath Ledger's performance of the joker before is Joaquin's performance comparable? <|endoftext|> I think what makes both of them so good is that they are shown with very different characteristics and do it very well. In this movie with Joaquin we have an origin story that keeps your attention. <|endoftext|> Thanks for your recommendation of the Joker. I'd like to see that movie. <|endoftext|> Id like to offer you this trailer. <|endoftext|> Thak you, I'd really like to see that movie now. <|endoftext|> Very nice, I am glad I could help. <|endoftext|> What is the Irsihman movie about? <|endoftext|> It is based on a true story regarding the disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa. The main character played by Robert De Niro is Frank Sheeran and he was mob hitman the became good friends with Hoffa. <|endoftext|> That sounds very interesting and I like movies based on true stories, especially with a great actor like Robert De Niro. <|endoftext|> Yes this was just released on Netflix just last week but it is a long move, 3.5 hours long. In both these movies I do predict that they will be well represented during award season. <|endoftext|> Oh, that's good it's on Netflix, I'll have to look for that. <|endoftext|> If you like Robert De Niro, I would like to mention that he is also in Joker. <|endoftext|> I really want to see the Joker now too since Robert de Niro is in it. Thank you for your recommendation of The Irishman too. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Seen anything good lately? <|endoftext|> Hi, Yeah <|endoftext|> Like what? I just saw Frozen 2, I liked it <|endoftext|> Frozen 2? i love power <|endoftext|> Yeah, it was a pretty powerful movie with a powerful message. Did you see the first one? <|endoftext|> Yeah i saw it <|endoftext|> What did you think of it? <|endoftext|> Very motivated and awesome <|endoftext|> Well then you'll probably like the sequel, do you like animated movies? <|endoftext|> Yeah i do watch animated sometime <|endoftext|> Well then I think you'd like this one, it's way better than any other animated movies out around this time. Like Addams Family was bad <|endoftext|> Addams Family was bad i watched the animated movies and is very interested <|endoftext|> That's great, I entirely recommend Frozen 2 for you to watch then. <|endoftext|> Okay. Thanks <|endoftext|> Personally, I would recommend watching it on DVD when it comes out. Because children in the theater aren't always well-behaved <|endoftext|> Lol... You right. but i will love to tell you to watch power too very interesting <|endoftext|> Oh power is a movie? I thought you just meant power in general! <|endoftext|> Nope... Power is a movie produce by Courtney A. Kemp <|endoftext|> Really? What's that about? <|endoftext|> Power is an American crime drama <|endoftext|> That sounds very good, I'll have to check that one some time. I hope you check out my movie too, I think it's worth a shot. Thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello howare you today <|endoftext|> I am fine and you? I am looking for a movie about court trials <|endoftext|> Any preference on the rating? <|endoftext|> Something like Pelicans Brief <|endoftext|> Is there a certain actor that youlike? <|endoftext|> Felicity Jones or Dan Stevens <|endoftext|> do you like old movies or something more current? <|endoftext|> Something more current within maybe 5 years <|endoftext|> other than Pelicans Brief is there any other court trials movies that you have seen? <|endoftext|> The Lincoln Lawyer <|endoftext|> Misconduct was release in 2016 have you heard of this movie <|endoftext|> No I haven't whose in it <|endoftext|> Josh Duhamel, Anthony Hopkins, Al Pacino, Alice Eve <|endoftext|> Is there any that are more current <|endoftext|> the movie Marshall was released in 2017 <|endoftext|> And who is in that movie <|endoftext|> Chadwick Boseman, Josh Gad, Kate Hudson, Sterling K. Brown <|endoftext|> When did that come out <|endoftext|> in 2017 and it is a Biography, Crime, Drama, History <|endoftext|> OK how long is it? <|endoftext|> it is 1hr 58 min <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'd love to help you find a movie trailer to watch. <|endoftext|> What movie do you recommend? <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> A good comedy or animated movie. <|endoftext|> Both are favorites of mine! I really loved Home. It's about an alien, a girl, and her cat, and their adventure to rescue her mom. It's hilarious. Is that something that might interest you? <|endoftext|> Maybe. I like animated ones like Angry Birds. <|endoftext|> Angry Birds was pretty funny. What about Ice Age? I think it has a similar type of humor. <|endoftext|> It does, I've already seen it, Skritch steals the show! <|endoftext|> I agree! Have you seen Over the Hedge? That's another household favorite. Hammy reminds me of my toddler. <|endoftext|> I've seen part of it. Wasn't there a new animated movie around halloween? <|endoftext|> The Addam's Family just came out last month. It's an animated remake of a classic! <|endoftext|> That's it! <|endoftext|> Is that one you'd be interested in? <|endoftext|> Yes, I want to see that one. I am a very big fan of the original Charles Addams cartoons. And the original series with John Astin and Caroline Jones. <|endoftext|> Great! It sounds like it would be perfect for you. <|endoftext|> I never did care for the New <|endoftext|> Well I hope the animated version is better. <|endoftext|> If it is done true to the original drawings, then it should be. I can't wait to see it. <|endoftext|> Me either. I haven't gotten a chance yet. <|endoftext|> Do you know if it will come to Netflix? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, what's up my friend? <|endoftext|> Hi I am looking for a movie recommendation <|endoftext|> Well, you've come to the right person. When you have a GF, you tend to see a lot of movies. <|endoftext|> I am married and have two kids ages 2 and 4 so of course I was wondering what would be suitable out there for them <|endoftext|> Do you have a particular genre in mind? Horror, comedy, etc... <|endoftext|> It would be a like atleast 1.5-2 hour max and a kids movie rated g <|endoftext|> Well, the obvious choice is QUOTATION_MARKA Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodQUOTATION_MARK. It's about Mr. Rogers. <|endoftext|> Do we know how long that movie is <|endoftext|> Its an hour and a half, so it should hit your sweet spot. <|endoftext|> That would be good. Do you have any ideas on what other movies are around that amount of time and are animated? <|endoftext|> For animation there is Playmobil: The Movie <|endoftext|> Oh nice. What is that one about? <|endoftext|> It abourt the building toy, Playmobil. Its made for kids so its only an hour and a half too. <|endoftext|> That is a good recommendation. You know how kids are my concern was making sure they were interested in the movie because it can be hard to sit through one <|endoftext|> You can't go wrong with either one. I would probably recommend the first one, but that's from an adult perspective. Unless the kids are into Mr Rogers, Playumobil should hit the spot for them best. <|endoftext|> I remember Mr rogers when I was a kid it would be nice to share that with my kids <|endoftext|> Yeah, me too. He was a very interesting guy. Seeing the film might make the kids get into him. <|endoftext|> That is true. I think Tom hanks will do a good job in that one <|endoftext|> Yeah. If you like Hanks and want something for the kids thats not too long, then this is the one. Reviews were great too. <|endoftext|> Thank you for your recommendation. I will choose Mr Rogers <|endoftext|> Playmobil: The Movie <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. How are you? Do you know what kind of movie you are looking for? <|endoftext|> Hi good thanks <|endoftext|> Great. What kinds of movies are you interested in? <|endoftext|> Im interest in drama and fiction movie <|endoftext|> Cool. Me too! I love drama but i love childrens fiction. What is your favorite movie? <|endoftext|> i like superman <|endoftext|> I can see we have a lot in common. I loved superman vs batman, really anything by DC Comics. Have you seen Wonderwoman? <|endoftext|> no yet <|endoftext|> If you like superman, you should really watch wonder woman. It ties in with Superman vs Batman. It is one of my kids and myself favorite movies. Lots of drama and its science fiction. <|endoftext|> yes i want wonder woman <|endoftext|> awesome. i will try to send it to you <|endoftext|> yes please <|endoftext|> ok, give me just a moment. Are you going to watch this with solo or with someone? <|endoftext|> im going solo <|endoftext|> Ive watched this movie several times. Both solo and with my family. <|endoftext|> nice i want to watch this solo <|endoftext|> still trying to work on getting it sent. In the meantime, do you know the actress who plays wonder woman? Gal Gadot? <|endoftext|> i see her sometime but i don't know the name actress <|endoftext|> This movie made me want to watch her other movies. She is great in wonder woman <|endoftext|> Nice i want to watch her movie about wonder woman soon possible <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy watching movies? <|endoftext|> I love watching movies. How about you? <|endoftext|> I spend a little too much time watching movies if I do say so myself haha <|endoftext|> Ok, Then you probably have really good recommendations. <|endoftext|> As a matter of fact I do. What movies have you seen lately by the way? <|endoftext|> Today i watch Avengers Endgame. Do you like Marvel movies? <|endoftext|> Yes! I love Marvel movies, they are the best. <|endoftext|> Can you recommend any other movies that you like as much? <|endoftext|> Well, what genre do you enjoy the most? <|endoftext|> Mostly action but there are some Mysteries that i enjoy as well. <|endoftext|> Have you heard of the movie QUOTATION_MARKNow You See Me?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> No i have not. <|endoftext|> It's a heist thriller/mystery movie, it's got good reviews and is very exciting. I think you'd enjoy it a lot, I sure did. <|endoftext|> Sounds very thrilling, i'll have to check it out. <|endoftext|> The film features an excellent cast of famous movie stars like Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson,Dave Franco, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman. <|endoftext|> Ok thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> No problem, well I should go now. It was a pleasure to speak with you. Bye! <|endoftext|> Yes it was a pleasure. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello out there!! <|endoftext|> hiii, can you send me a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Well what type of movie do you like? Action, Drama, Comedy, romance? <|endoftext|> well, i like action movies alot. what you like in movies? <|endoftext|> I like action and drama <|endoftext|> wow, thats cool. movies with artificial intelligence is my current favourite. <|endoftext|> What about Sci Fi Action, I think you should check out The Rise Of Skywalker coming out December 20th <|endoftext|> oh yeah, i like though. what about your experience on the movie? <|endoftext|> All the star wars movies are really good. I promise you will like it. <|endoftext|> yes of course, i do like them. can you recommend me any other movie ? <|endoftext|> ok how about IRobot <|endoftext|> yes perfect, this is the movie i want. thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> i am sure you will like it. Youare very welcome <|endoftext|> okay, take care, happy thanksgiving. <|endoftext|> happy thanks giving to you <|endoftext|> i like will smith acting <|endoftext|> Me to you should look into Independence Day as well, it sci fi but not AI <|endoftext|> oh ok, i will watch it soon.any other movies of him? <|endoftext|> Enemy of the state has technology iin it to, watch that <|endoftext|> sure i will <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I am here to help you look for movie trailer! <|endoftext|> hello! <|endoftext|> I'm going to start broadly--what kind of movies you like? <|endoftext|> I usually like documentary films, or at least historically accurate drama films! <|endoftext|> Interesting, not very many people that I know like those sort of films, but I do. <|endoftext|> That's great, I love documentaries! It's fun to learn and be entertained at the same time. What's your favorite? <|endoftext|> Well, even though I'm young in age, I do think older documentaries are still the best that has been done. Even though I would not classify this documentary as fun in a joyful manner, it is informative about a serious topic, the  Holocuast. The documentary is called Shoah. <|endoftext|> That sounds very difficult to watch but interesting. Is it about a specific person who lived through the Holocaust, or a more general documentary? <|endoftext|> A general documentary about how the whole process of genocide against European Jews was carried. The unique thing about it is that it does not rely on a single piece of film from the 1930s or 1940s. The director, a French man travels to different parts of Europe, including the sites where the concentration camps once stood, and interviews the QUOTATION_MARKbystandersQUOTATION_MARK that saw their neighbors being removed. He also includes the input of prominent historians. <|endoftext|> That sounds really interesting! One would have to be in the right frame of mind to watch it I imagine, but the interviews sound fascinating and disturbing. Thanks for the info, I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> Although I forgot to mention a very important fact about the documentary that deters people from watching, It has to be seen on different sittings because it runs close to 9.5 hours, which I think reflects the seriousness of the subject is addressing. <|endoftext|> That doesn't sound bad, I just watched the Ken Burns PBS documentary, which is 10+ hours I believe. I really enjoyed it. Have you watched any of his documentaries? <|endoftext|> No, not really and the reason being that I read what some historians had to say about his Civil War documentary and it did not sound encouraging for my taste. <|endoftext|> That's too bad. I really enjoyed his Vietnam documentary because he did a good job of interviewing all sides and not just Americans. But his Civil War documentary was more focused on telling interesting anecdotes than the history it seemed like. <|endoftext|> Well, I think my fits perfectly your movie preferences. It is subtitled, obviously, but as a film buff I do check lists that come out in which critics rank their favorite movies and Shoah consistently ranks as one of the best, if not the best, documentary of all time. <|endoftext|> I'm not much of a film buff, but always happy to check out some films from before my time that I may have overlooked! Another good one that the critics also seem to like is QUOTATION_MARKHoop Dreams,QUOTATION_MARK have you seen that? <|endoftext|> Unfortunately no, I had not even heard of it. As you mentioned liking historically accurate, I do enjoy those as well. Although they might not be presented from the viewpoint of an important figure, they usually revolve around a important event like The Biggest Short with Ryan Gosling, Steve Carrell and Christian Bale. It presents a point of view about what led to the 2008 economic crash. <|endoftext|> I did enjoy the Biggest Short. I enjoy Revolutionary War ere history but haven't found any great documentaries on that yet. John Adams miniseries on HBO was pretty good for a drama though. <|endoftext|> How about earlier movies about earlier periods like the 1500s? <|endoftext|> I'm not very familiar with that time period unfortunately. I know a little bit about some of the explorers but that's about it. Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Well, this is a movie not a documentary. But I consider it one of my favorite movies of all time. It's called QUOTATION_MARKAguirre, The Wrath of GodQUOTATION_MARK It came out in 1972 and the reason why I like is because, even though it's not based on a specific, single reliable event, it's based on the idea among some Spanish conquistadores that there was hidden city made of gold (El Dorado) in the Amazon. I really appreciate the German director attempt to recreate that period. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> hi, I love to watch movies. <|endoftext|> Me too! Do you have a favorite genre? <|endoftext|> family, action, and horror <|endoftext|> Nice!

Enjoy if you do! <|endoftext|> I will probably enjoy it. <|endoftext|> What about any Ari Aster films like Midsommer? <|endoftext|> I heard about Midsommer, but have never seen it. <|endoftext|> It definitely has a whole new feel for a horror movie. Do you have a specific genre within horror movies that you enjoy most? <|endoftext|> blood and gore <|endoftext|> nice, into any of the Rob Zombie movies then? <|endoftext|> yes like the halloween that was directed by him. <|endoftext|> Yeah, there's a new one out called 3 From Hell <|endoftext|> I would be willing to watch that. <|endoftext|> I'm unable to link the 3 From Hell trailer so i'm gunna link a different Rob Zombie one, cool? lol <|endoftext|> sounds good to me <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi i am here to help you <|endoftext|> Would you recommend a movie? <|endoftext|> yes for sure .what kind of movie you are interested in <|endoftext|> Action and commedy <|endoftext|> whats the last movie you watched <|endoftext|> It was an action type. Let me check in my list <|endoftext|> ok do you want to see similar kind of movie now <|endoftext|> Yes, I would appreciate <|endoftext|> did you perfer other language movies all so <|endoftext|> Just English movies <|endoftext|> ok have you ever watched running scared its a old movie <|endoftext|> No. Do you see like Close? Do you know that one? <|endoftext|> Two street-wise Chicago cops have to shake off some rust after returning from a Key West vacation to pursue a drug dealer who nearly killed them in the past. this is the gener of the movie . <|endoftext|> Yeah. So please recommend on that line? <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer <|endoftext|> Yeah sure. <|endoftext|> Action, Comedy, Crime, Thriller.so it will be 13 plus age .its a good movie to watch .released in 1986 <|endoftext|> Thank you very much.

It was a cute movie lol <|endoftext|> I agree, it was a cute movie! Each actor definitely played their character. <|endoftext|> Yes they did! It had a good message to the movie <|endoftext|> I agree. I really enjoyed the message that it doesn't take being mean and careless to gain happiness in life. Humility is key. <|endoftext|> Yes it is, I agree <|endoftext|> What was your favorite scene in the movie? <|endoftext|> I think when they see the hot guy come in and she forgets that shes 12 lol <|endoftext|> Oh okay lol, yes that seen is classic <|endoftext|> I cant find the move on the search idk why <|endoftext|> Ah man that sucks. Do you have a movie recommendation in mind? <|endoftext|> Have you seen the grinch? <|endoftext|> With Jim Carey? <|endoftext|> Yes that one! <|endoftext|> Yes, I love that movie! Jim Carey really played the character lol <|endoftext|> Yes he did! He's an amazing actor <|endoftext|> He is lol. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi my nameis matt, i hear you would like to see a movie, any genre in particular you are interested <|endoftext|> My name is Jaime, nice to meet you. I like a variety of movies, but most recently I've enjoyed action or comedy <|endoftext|> cool, talking about action have you seen the latest trailer for Terminator, they finally got James Cameron back along with Linda Hammilton back to the franchise <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that trailor, Linda Hamilton is great. I'm always hesitant with remakes though. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> i have seen it, and it is not a remake, it is a direct sequel to T2 <|endoftext|> Oh thats cool. Did they replace Arnold? <|endoftext|> no same Arnold, just older... tell you secret they even got the original John Connor back <|endoftext|> You have me sold already. Did the trailer show how they were going to continue from the original? <|endoftext|> that is the big twist... can't spoil it <|endoftext|> Such suspense. I'll definitely give it a watch. As long as it doesn't have Daenerys in it I think it will be a good one. <|endoftext|> lol, she is not in it. movie is good, way better that Terminator Genesys <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation :) I like your style <|endoftext|> i appreciate that, i enjoy movies, specially if they dont suck, and this last Terminator definatly doesn't. it only took 20 years to make a good one again <|endoftext|> James Cameron is a good one to have do it too. He is usually pretty spot on with the graphics and effects. <|endoftext|> i agree, after avatar i did not think he would come back to the franchise but he did, i feel like he saw what they were doing and had enough <|endoftext|> Ugh Avatar is a sore spot in movie history. Visually beautiful, but that was the longest painful watch <|endoftext|> lol, i agree with you, i hope you really enjoy Terninator Dark Fate as i did <|endoftext|> I think I will. I'll have to see where its playing <|endoftext|> it sould be playing everywhere, i saw it at a drive in, and that is saying something <|endoftext|> Oooh good idea, I've never been to a drive in. I know my plans now! <|endoftext|> am glad i was able to help you it was my pleasure <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation, thank you :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi buddy. What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Hi! I recently watched once upon a time in hollywood <|endoftext|> What was your favorite part of the movie? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed the character development and the idea that the entire time I thought I would know the ending as it followed the Manson murders, but it had a plot twist! <|endoftext|> So, you like movies with plot twists? <|endoftext|> I do, I do not enjoy movies where I can guess the endings <|endoftext|> I recommend the movie QUOTATION_MARKThe GameQUOTATION_MARK starring Michael Douglas <|endoftext|> Ok great, why do you think so? <|endoftext|> It has not one, but many different plot twists. <|endoftext|> that's awesome. I will check the movie out! <|endoftext|> Got it <|endoftext|> Is there anything else that you enjoy about The Game? <|endoftext|> I think you will like this movie it's called 13 sins <|endoftext|> Tell me about it! I have never heard of it! <|endoftext|> It's about a salesman who is forced by an unknown person to preform 13 sinister acts one more sinister than the next <|endoftext|> ooh that sounds interesting! Who stars in 13 sins? <|endoftext|> Mark Webber and Ron Perlman. <|endoftext|> I definitely think I would enjoy that movie, thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> No problem. I think you will love it. <|endoftext|> What is your favorite part of 13 sins? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! Is there a particular genre of movie you're interested in? <|endoftext|> I normally love comedies. <|endoftext|> Hmm....well lets try to narrow that down a bit. There are all kinds of different comedies and some people prefer a certain kind. I, for one, am a fan of stand up. But you've got Farce, Dark Comedy, Romantic Comedy, Action Comedy and such types of Parodies. Which one would you be more open to seeing? <|endoftext|> I like stand up comedy as well, but I prefer it to not have a lot of profanity or explicit content. I love action comedies and romantic comedies. Same stipulations though. <|endoftext|> Thats good! So we know you don't want anything too dirty and raunchy. What type of stipulations do you have pertaining to action and romantic comedies? <|endoftext|> That's pretty much it. I also like movies based around World War II. Though I know those genres typically do not overlap necessarily. Do you have any recommendations for those genres? <|endoftext|> I might have a title or two. You were right about those two genre's not exactly blending well or very often, but rest assured it does happen! How do you feel about Bette Midler and James Caan? <|endoftext|> I had to google James Caan. Ha! I like both of them a lot. I have yet to see a movie featuring Bette Midler that I did not enjoy. <|endoftext|> Ha! You can never go wrong with Ms. Midler. I think The First Wives Club is one of my all time favorites. Midler and Hawn make an excellent team! <|endoftext|> I have yet to watch that movie. I remember seeing the trailer for it all the time when I watched an old VHS of A Very Brady Sequel, but I have yet to actually see it. <|endoftext|> Well I think I may have the perfect movie for you. There are strong comedic elements, its set during World War 2 and starring....Bette Midler! <|endoftext|> That does sound pretty perfect! <|endoftext|> I thought so! Its one of my favorites. Something I watch when I'm feeling nostalgic as it was released in 1991. Bette Midler and James Caan make an excellent team and of course, since it is set during WWII, you'll want to have some tissues handy. <|endoftext|> I appreciate that warning. I am definitely a crier! Haha! <|endoftext|> Oh, there's nothing wrong with having a good cry every now and then! It's good for the soul. Its a painless way to release pent up emotions. At least that's what I tell myself. <|endoftext|> I would think you right since I tell myself the same thing and I'm a Social Work major in college.;) <|endoftext|> Oh my. So you already HAD the tissues on hand! Well it's a good thing then cause I know for a fact this movie has squeezed some tears out of me, no matter how great of a mood I was in when I started watching it. <|endoftext|> Well the anticipation is killing me! Ha! So what is the movie? <|endoftext|> The movie is called 'For the Boys', and I really do think you'll like it, if not love it. Its moving and touching in all the right ways! <|endoftext|> Well that sounds like a dream. Can you tell me a little about the plot? I like to have at least a little information to mentally and emotionally prepare myself. <|endoftext|> Of course! I suppose using today's standards, it would be considered a dramedy (drama comedy) and is traces the life of Midler's character who teamed up with Caan's character, Eddie Sparks, who was a famous entertainer. He thinks he needs something to help bolster his act so he enlists the help of Dixie Leonard, Midler's character. They primarily get together to train US Troops during the war. <|endoftext|> Wait a minute. They're entertainers but they train the military? <|endoftext|> Oh gosh. I'm sorry, not train, entertain....my goodness. Please forgive my mind! <|endoftext|> HAHA! It's totally okay. I was like QUOTATION_MARKWhat qualifies showman to train the military?!QUOTATION_MARK Haha! So Bette Midler has some singing in it? <|endoftext|> Yes! I know its not a popular stance, but I adore her voice. Its so soulful! <|endoftext|> I love it too! That's definitely a selling point for me! This movie sounds absolutely perfect. I can't believe I've never heard of it. I will definitely have to check it out! <|endoftext|> Well hopefully the trailer sells you completely. Though I'm sure you'll love it! <|endoftext|> Should I watch the trailer first? <|endoftext|> I always encourage people to watch trailers because there can always be that one thing that they can see in the trailer that can make them excited to see it or hesitant. Either way, I'd rather walk into something with somewhat of an idea of what I'm walking into. <|endoftext|> You're right! Should I watch now or watch it before we end this chat, just in case...? <|endoftext|> Watch it at your leisure! If you have the opportunity to see it when the chat ends, go for it! <|endoftext|> Sounds great. I will definitely go check it out. Thank you so much for your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I really enjoy watching thrillers and intellectually engaging movies <|endoftext|> Like horror thrillers or more just suspense? <|endoftext|> I really like suspense thrillers that have some historical reference like The DaVinci Code <|endoftext|> Interesting. Do you have a favorite actor/actress? <|endoftext|> I like Tom Hanks a lot <|endoftext|> What would be your favorite movie of his? <|endoftext|> Definitely The DaVinci Code <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Captain Phillips? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't - was it good? <|endoftext|> I think it is a great movie and would highly recommend. It has Tom Hanks and is a Biological Thriller <|endoftext|> I think I will go see it tomorrow after work. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Perfect! That would be my recommendation then <|endoftext|> Thanks so much. I always like a good thriller <|endoftext|> Then you should enjoy this, it will keep you on your toes <|endoftext|> Are there historical references? <|endoftext|> Yeah its based on a true story of Somali pirates taking over a cargo ship <|endoftext|> I've heard about that one - should be interesting.I think I can find it on Netflix <|endoftext|> I hope you can, or maybe amazon <|endoftext|> I have both, so I can look now. Thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi I am here to help you look for a movie trailer! what type of trailers do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> I like comedies. Something that's well written and clever. <|endoftext|> I like comedies also. Who is your favorite comedian? <|endoftext|> I like comedians too, but I don't think of comedy movies and comedians in the same category exactly. Again, I like clever comedy much more so than just comedy that relies on shock value. <|endoftext|> when you say clever comedies are you referencing to ones like to the tonight show? <|endoftext|> I mean clever as in well written dialog vs. something that relies on slapstick. So more When Harry Met Sally and less Dumb and Dumber. <|endoftext|> Yes I like those also! Have you seen the dialog commercial with skittles and she kisses him and he becomes infected with skittles also. I that one was really clever. <|endoftext|> Yes, I do think I remember that commercial. <|endoftext|> I saw Dumb and Dumber but was there a part 2? I don't think that I have seen it! <|endoftext|> Yeah, I never had any desire to watch part 2. I like Jeff Daniels a lot, but that's just not my type of comedy. <|endoftext|> I you have not seen Coming to America with Eddie Murphy I would like to suggest that movie for you to watch! It has a nice comedy content. <|endoftext|> I saw it a long time ago. Definitely leans more toward the goofy vs clever dialog though. So not really a good fit for me. <|endoftext|> I often think about a classic movie Weird Science. What do you think of that one? <|endoftext|> Still in the style of goofy vs clever. I'm not a fan of those types of movies. Maybe something with Sandra Bullock? <|endoftext|> Yes I like Sandra Bullock especially the Movie Rush and there is a recent one she just  stared in. <|endoftext|> Do you mean Speed? I know she does other things too, but IQUOTATION_MARKm looking for a comedy. <|endoftext|> Yes I meant Speed It has been along time since have seen that movie but Bird Box  and Miss Congeniality was also some of my favorites. <|endoftext|> Miss Congenialtiy sounds good. It's definitely one that I'd like to see again. It's a little bit slap-stick, but also clever dialog. I would accept that recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> I would also like to recommend Foxy Brown <|endoftext|> Definitely a fan of Pam Grier so I'd take that recommendation as well. Thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> HI, I'm here to recommend a movie to you. <|endoftext|> hi, i love to watch movies. <|endoftext|> Seen any good ones lately? <|endoftext|> yes, i have watched ford vs ferrari yesterday. <|endoftext|> Did you like it? <|endoftext|> I loved it, one of the best movies I seen it. <|endoftext|> Got it. <|endoftext|> I like to watch usually horror, action and sports movies. <|endoftext|> I would recommend you try out Midsommar, if you  haven't seen it already. It's a horror movie. <|endoftext|> ok, I would be willing to try that movie. <|endoftext|> Another one you may like is Hereditary, which is by the same director. Both movies are really intense horror films that are really well made, you love them! <|endoftext|> hereditary sounds familiar. but can you recommend Midsommar, i have never seen that movie. <|endoftext|> Will do, got it. <|endoftext|> sounds good to me. <|endoftext|> TO give you more detail, it's about a couple who goes to sweden after one of them experiences tragedy and then they tango with this norse hippy cult. <|endoftext|> that sounds like a kind of movie I would enjoy. <|endoftext|> You will, it gets pretty crazy towards the end, a bit trippy, and definitely violent and gruesome. <|endoftext|> seems like very bloody type of movie. <|endoftext|> THere's a ton of different stuff that happens. <|endoftext|> oh yeah it sounds suspenseful and scary. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? What genre of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Hello! I love romantic comedy  and Drama mainly. <|endoftext|> Have you seen 50 First Dates? <|endoftext|> I have and it is exactly the type of movie I like! Great movie! <|endoftext|> I agree. How about Hitch? <|endoftext|> I don't think I have seen it, who is in it? <|endoftext|> Kevin James and Will Smith. Will Smith runs a secretive dating business where he helps awkward guys get into a relationship with the girls they like. It is a good one that I have seen several times. <|endoftext|> Oh, I love Will Smith! Is it an older movie? I can't believe I haven't seen it. <|endoftext|> It is but it is very funny. It's from 2005. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, I am such a movie fanatic I am surprised I missed this one. So it has a good sense of humor and not the silly off the wall type of humor? <|endoftext|> Yes, I don't like the stuff that is really crazy. It is more humor like the guys who just are not good around girls. Will Smith is of course very suave in this movie. Kevin is one of his clients. <|endoftext|> Oh that's great! I figured Will Smith would be in a great film. It does sound very good. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer then? <|endoftext|> I really would love to watch the trailer! Who else is in the film? Any leading ladies? <|endoftext|> Eva Mendes is one of the main ones. I will let you watch the trailer then. I hope you enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> Eva Mendez? I love her! Thank you so much! <|endoftext|> She is a great actress and is very classy. <|endoftext|> Yes she is! I am very excited to accept your recommendation about watching a trailer for this movie, I am sure I will enjoy it! <|endoftext|> It makes me want to see it again. It was great chatting with you. <|endoftext|> Yes,I love watching good movies again. Have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am going to help recommend a movie to you! <|endoftext|> What movie would you recommend? <|endoftext|> I recently saw Frozen 2 and even as an adult I really enjoyed the movie. It wasn't too cheesy, the music was fantastic and the visuals were breathtaking! What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I did enjoy Frozen. Typically I enjoy action movies, but I do enjoy a good kids movie. Other movies such as Interstellar are great because they get the mind thinking. <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Martian? Matt Damon is amazing in it! <|endoftext|> I have, also an amazing movie! <|endoftext|> I would really recommend seeing Frozen 2 if you haven't seen it yet. There are some really funny scenes in there that throw you back to an 80s/90s boy band music video, some action scenes that just look amazing and I couldn't believe they were animated and really have some heavy themes in it that you wouldn't expect from a Disney Movie. <|endoftext|> I will certainly go see Frozen 2 <|endoftext|> Wonderful, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! <|endoftext|> I hope so too! <|endoftext|> I have the trailer ready for you to watch as well, in case you haven't seen it yet. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it yet <|endoftext|> It does a good job of showing some of the themes without giving it away. <|endoftext|> I'd love to see it <|endoftext|> The new songs in the movie are really catchy. There is one song that I have heard on the radio that it seems like they are pushing for QUOTATION_MARKLet it Go 2QUOTATION_MARK but there is another song towards the end of the movie I think is way more powerful. <|endoftext|> That's cool! <|endoftext|> If you have the option to see the movie in Imax or a higher def screen I recommend it because the animation and visuals are so great. Elsa's magic looks amazing. <|endoftext|> Unfortunately I do not <|endoftext|> You will still be amazed by it! Its a great movie! <|endoftext|> Great I will go see it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello!! how are you today? what kind of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> Hi there. I'm well. Thanks for asking. I like a lot of different kinds of movies, but I'm especially in the mood for a good Christmas movie. <|endoftext|> That's lovely to hear may i make a suggestion? to you i used to love watching it as a kid every December with my family. <|endoftext|> I'd love to hear any suggestions you might have. Watching movies together was always a holiday tradition for us as well. <|endoftext|> rudolph the red nosed reindeer original claymation film. was a family favorite of ours and the original animate Grinch was my favorite as a kid. i feel it has alot built in to the 2 films with american Christmas culture <|endoftext|> Those are two of my favorites for sure. But I'm looking for something a little different. Not a cartoon. And nothing too QUOTATION_MARKcheesy.QUOTATION_MARK Something that's more comedy than drama. <|endoftext|> oooh i have a good suggesting what about elf staring Will Ferrel its about Buddy (Will Ferrell) was accidentally transported to the North Pole as a toddler and raised to adulthood among Santa's elves. <|endoftext|> That sounds perfect! I accept the recommendation. Thank you. <|endoftext|> is their any more recommendations you are looking for ? <|endoftext|> No I think that sounds perfect. <|endoftext|> ok have have a lovely night and happy holiday <|endoftext|> You too. Thanks again for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> i do appoligize for my late delays in replies  my typing is a little slow <|endoftext|> That's quite alright. I think we still need to chat a few more times before the system recognizes that we have a succesful recommendation. <|endoftext|> may i make a another suggestion you must watch The Night Before <|endoftext|> I actually started that one, but lost interest. Maybe I should give it another shot. <|endoftext|> how about Mixed Nuts its a wonderful classic comedy <|endoftext|> I've never heard of it, but the cast looks awesome so I'll definitely check that one out. Thanks! <|endoftext|> is there anything else i can help you with this evening? <|endoftext|> No thanks. Now if the system would just let us go ... LOL! <|endoftext|> elf <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i like funny movies and suspenseful movies <|endoftext|> Thats awesome! do you have a favorite? <|endoftext|> i like the wedding singer a lot <|endoftext|> I think that movie is funny too. <|endoftext|> adam sandler is so funny <|endoftext|> I think so too! <|endoftext|> do you have a recommendation for me that is funny <|endoftext|> What about waterboy? <|endoftext|> i did not like that one <|endoftext|> Hm. What about anger management? <|endoftext|> who is in that one? <|endoftext|> adam sandler and jack nicholson <|endoftext|> i  like both of them. i would like to see that trailer <|endoftext|> Have you seen it before? <|endoftext|> no. i have not seen it <|endoftext|> Its great. Do you like jack nicholson? <|endoftext|> i love him <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, what can I help you with? <|endoftext|> I'm looking for a movie I can enjoy with my kids. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do your kids like? <|endoftext|> Well, my daughter is a teen and likes sappy loves stories, but my boys are younger and like anime and action. <|endoftext|> Let's see... I can think of three movies that might fit. There is Frozen 2, Playing with Fire and Maleficanent: Mistress of Evil. Would any of those work? <|endoftext|> All of those look good, but I'd love to know more about Playing with Fire. <|endoftext|> I believe Playing with Fire is about three kids rescured by firefighters. The kids wreck havoc at the station while waiting to be picked up. Oh, before I forget, there is another movie, Abonimable. <|endoftext|> Is abonimable animated or live action? <|endoftext|> Abonimable is an animated movie. <|endoftext|> Any familiar voices? <|endoftext|> Chloe Bennet. Sarah Paulson, Eddie Izzard <|endoftext|> So, what is it about? <|endoftext|> A young girl finds a yeti on her roof and tries to help him get back home before being captured by some unsavory people. <|endoftext|> That sounds cute. Is playing with fire a live action? <|endoftext|> Yes it is, it and it stars John Cena. <|endoftext|> Oh, my boys love John Cena! Who else is in it? <|endoftext|> John Leguizamo, Judy Greer Dennis Haysbert, Keegan-Micheal Key <|endoftext|> Do you know the time length of the movie? <|endoftext|> It runs about 1 1/2 hours <|endoftext|> Do you think it is something little boys would like? <|endoftext|> I think so, if the love John Cena. I think it would be good one to go and see. <|endoftext|> Ok, I think between those two, Playing with Fire may be the one to see. Do you agree? <|endoftext|> Yes, it's a good family move. <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation. I will check it out. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I'm well; how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like a variety of movies.

I really liked the fight scenes between Spiderman and mysterio <|endoftext|> I would like to recommend a movie trailer to you. Do you want a movie trailer with a similar story to Spiderman Far From Home? <|endoftext|> yes, that would be great <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch this movie trailer? Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? <|endoftext|> Yes, I'm definitely interested <|endoftext|> great! I am looking forward to this movie. I already have tickets <|endoftext|> Awesome. I'm excited about it too <|endoftext|> have you seen the other Star Wars movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, all of them <|endoftext|> Have you liked the spin off movies like Rogue One? <|endoftext|> Yes, but less than the main ones <|endoftext|> I think my least favorite was Solo.

I love all genres, thriller, drama, suspense, family, drama. love meryl streep and marlee matlin <|endoftext|> That's great!!

Well what is the last movie you seen? <|endoftext|> honestly...last night the Grinch...but over the weekend I watch the newest Child's Play movie (chucky) <|endoftext|> I enjoy watching Child's play too. whats your favorite scene? <|endoftext|> I've never been a fan of child's play, but my sister wanted me to watch this one...the best one out of them all...there were a few funny parts where chucky (now named buddi) would repeat what was said, explicit stuff, but funny coming from a doll and the way he would say it. It was a gruesome but tolerable movie <|endoftext|> Aww ok great. I can relate as well on that. He has such a explicit vocabulary but funny at times <|endoftext|> exactly...my favorite horror movies is like the conjuring franchise...anything Ed and Lorraine Warrren..i have seen them all....any recomendations <|endoftext|> How about Annabelle Comes Home <|endoftext|> loved it...she absolutely freaks me out...dolls and clowns scare me on a whole new level <|endoftext|> Great I remember you saying you like drama and suspense movies? So would you like this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I'll watch it. i have seen it, but some trailers show different parts of the movie. <|endoftext|> Would you prefer to watch The Conjuring 2 instead? <|endoftext|> if I had to choose out of the two, for sure Conjuring 2. <|endoftext|> Awesome great Ill get that going for you right away <|endoftext|> thank you. <|endoftext|> Your very welcome.

I really think you would enjoy Death wish, so intense. <|endoftext|> sounds like it just might be a one to see. a dad and husband going out for revenge kinda like john wick for his puppy. lol. <|endoftext|> Yes, I love John Wick. have you seen John Wick 3? Amazing! <|endoftext|> i dont think ive seen 3 but my fiance says we did, but truth be told if we did i dont remember it... which is unlike me to do. also i think i typo'd charles bronsen earlier boy movies have come a long way from back in his day. <|endoftext|> I know! It is amazing what they do with the movies now haha, I remember the Bronson movie! <|endoftext|> jw 3, once upon a deadpool and Deeath wish. i know jw3 is gonna be great, ive heard OUDP is funnyand the Death wish may be great just because bruce is great. its been a long time since ive seen the bronson movie i was just a kid when it came out. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I was a kid too lol, I know, have you seen Avengers Endgame? Awesome movie! <|endoftext|> actually i havent seen any since civil war. the fiance isnt into the action super heroe movies as much as i am. <|endoftext|> Ok, how about Taken, Mad Max Fury Road, ironman.... <|endoftext|> the taken movies were great, ive seen all three ironman movies ( awsome) i have yet to see madmax i do want to see it. <|endoftext|> Great!

It was cool! <|endoftext|> Ah - I'm a nanny and the boy i take care of has been telling me all about that lol. Are you into alot of superhero/action based movies or are you a little more across the board? <|endoftext|> my spouse and kids like action, so I go along for the ride :) but they are okay <|endoftext|> What else are you typically into? Do you usually look more toward family based movies so you can all watch together? <|endoftext|> Yes, I like documentaries or real life stories. <|endoftext|> Awesome. More of a positive story about the underdog rising above, thriller documentaries, food industry, etc.? Or kind of just across the board? I myself like a lot of different documentaries - I get lost on YouTube a lot watching trailers lol. <|endoftext|> I liked a documentary about adoption stories, and also the Mr. Rogers PBS documentary <|endoftext|> OH MY GOD I LOVED that!!!! Mr. Rogers was such an influential person to me back in my younger years (I say being 27 currently) and that documentary made me cry so hard! He was such an amazing man with such great core values. <|endoftext|> Yes, it made me cry too. He definitely showed people love. <|endoftext|> I really loved that documentary. There was also a really great one I watched with my boyfriend a little while ago about life with invisible illness (I struggle with chronic, debilitating pain but at such a young age you get a lot of doubt both from medical professionals and employers as well as family and friends) and it was a really positive story about finding the best in a less than ideal situation and creating change. It was really amazing <|endoftext|> That sounds so encouraging! What movie do you recommend? <|endoftext|> It's called Unrest - it came out in 2017 and is told by a Harvard Ph.D. student who is bedridden by a disease that doctors can't find an exact cause of. It goes into her partner's day to day life taking care of his wife who others don't see as really sick, and the lengths they go to fight for the proper diagnosis together as they travel around the world finding others with similar conditions. <|endoftext|> Wow, that sounds fabulous! I accept the recommendation. I'd love to see it. <|endoftext|> That's awesome! I selected the trailer for you so that you can watch it. I hope you love it! Have a great rest of your day!(: <|endoftext|> Thanks so much! I hope you do as well. <|endoftext|> And don't forget to stay warm! <|endoftext|> You too as well! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, my name is Matt, i hear you are interested in watching a movie <|endoftext|> I sure am.

I am looking for something more thought provoking. <|endoftext|> i understand how about the dragon prnce on netflix fron the creators of Avatar theanimated series <|endoftext|> Is that an anima? Because if it is, I believe I have already seen that one too. <|endoftext|> it is, wow you know a lot about tv and movies too <|endoftext|> I do watch alot of movies and netflix. I have kinda ran out of options. <|endoftext|> how about Mother on Netflix, about a girl raised by a robot in a distopian future <|endoftext|> I have seen that one too. It has a really good ending. <|endoftext|> i agree, how about nine, its about a group of QUOTATION_MARKpuppetsQUOTATION_MARK in a post apocaliptic earth, i like it...its a bit old but it is amazing <|endoftext|> That is a pixar movie. It came out awhile ago. It is very dark and kinda sad. I have seen that one too. <|endoftext|> wow am impressed, i like it a lot, the realationships are what draws me to it. Similar to a movie called QUOTATION_MARKlet me inQUOTATION_MARK with Chloe Moretz <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one. <|endoftext|> it is a great movie. it is about a boy that gets bullied and befriends a child vampire and their relationship, as e ages and she won't <|endoftext|> I think I like that recommendation. <|endoftext|> i hope you do, it has a little suspense and it reminds me a little of Stranger Things how despite being kids the action is not childish <|endoftext|> Ok, I would like to see that one. <|endoftext|> cool, am glad i was able to help and am glad you enjoy movies and tv as much as i do. <|endoftext|> Thank you very much.

Iron Man is very action packed movie, and is very funny at times. <|endoftext|> Yes please! <|endoftext|> Awesome! Definitely my favorite MCU movie. Unlike the later movies, iron man was some what based in reality, it has a certain grit that the other movies don't. The suits feel heavy and tangible. <|endoftext|> Perfect.

It was great! <|endoftext|> Okay, do you prefer to see a comedic thriller, or just any comedy in general? <|endoftext|> Great question, I think at this time I'd like just a comedy. <|endoftext|> Thanks for that. Is there a specific actor/actress you'd like to see? <|endoftext|> Not particularly, but I love any actor or actress from Saturday Night Live. <|endoftext|> How about one with Will Ferrell? He was very popular on SNL. <|endoftext|> YES! He is one of the best!:) <|endoftext|> I'd like to recommend QUOTATION_MARKHolmes & WatsonQUOTATION_MARK. It's relatively new, from last year, and features Will Ferrell and also John C. Reilly. <|endoftext|> I haven't even heard about this movie before. Do you have a brief synopsis? <|endoftext|> Sure thing, it's a kind of satirical take on the story about Sherlock Holmes. Are you familiar with Sherlock Holmes? <|endoftext|> Yes, of course! So, if this is a QUOTATION_MARKSherlock HolmesQUOTATION_MARK like film, my guess this is more of a Comedic Mystery? Is that accurate? <|endoftext|> Yes it's a comedy/crime/mystery film! <|endoftext|> Love it! I accept this recommendation. I am going to go find where I can watch it. Thank you! <|endoftext|> Awesome. It was great chatting with you today :) <|endoftext|> To you as well. Thanks for the help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you find a good movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Hello, thanks for helping me. <|endoftext|> Sure thing! What genre of movie do you usually watch? <|endoftext|> I like action and fantasy. I also like good character driven movies. <|endoftext|> Me too. Movies where someone grows throughout the story are somehow really rewarding to watch. What would you say is your favorite movie that you've seen in the last year? <|endoftext|> Thats hard to say. The last Avengers movie was really good. <|endoftext|> ?Ohh, that movie gave me so many different emotions. Thor had me laughing so hard, but I sobbed at the funeral for Black Widow. If you liked that movie, have you thought of watching Spiderman: Far From Home? <|endoftext|> I have thought about seeing that movie. Is it any good? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed it! The interesting part to me was seeing how Peter's friends from the first movie play such a large role in helping him as Spiderman, considering that I would usually think of Spiderman as a loner by necessity. It made me think about the character in a different way. <|endoftext|> That is a new take, I think your right seeing him as a loner. I enjoed the Wolverine movies he is certainly a loner. Very character driven I enjoyed watching his emotions as he delt with taking carte of X-23 in the last film. I will give Spiderman Far From home a watch, thank you for the sugestion. <|endoftext|> You're right, those two characters have a lot of similarities story-wise, even though their personalities are so different. Sure thing! And if you have not seen the first one yet, Spider-Man Homecoming, make sure to give that a watch first! <|endoftext|> Will do thanks. Have a good day. <|endoftext|> Thanks, you as well! <|endoftext|> Oh,is Spider-Man Homecoming the newest ones. Looks like there have been multipule Spiderman movies in the past fifteen years. <|endoftext|> Yes, Spider-man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home are the newest versions. Tom Holland plays Spiderman in these movies and they are a part of the ongoing Marvel cinematic universe, which is why this Spiderman was in the recent Avengers movie that you mentioned! <|endoftext|> Oh, good. Thank makes sense. I can never keep track with all the reboots and things in movies some time. <|endoftext|> That makes sense, Spiderman has been redone so many times! There is even a new animated movie called Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse that subverts the traditional story by skipping most of it. It would be a fun option to pair with the Tom Holland versions for comparison. <|endoftext|> Ok, I think I have heard of that too. Spider Gwen is in it. I will check that out too! <|endoftext|> Yes, she is! There are several versions of Spider-man from comics over the years. The whole movie is a beautiful callback to the comics. Well, I hope you enjoy the Spider-man movies, and hopefully the Tom Holland ones will add to your enjoyment of the Avengers movies, too. <|endoftext|> I will. Thank you so much for your time. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Hi! I'm looking forward to watching something new. What do you recommend? <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like fantasy action/adventure movies <|endoftext|> Oh I do too!!

Though Marvel movies have been better the last few years than DC <|endoftext|> I have seen many DC movies but love Marvel! Have you seen Endgame yet? <|endoftext|> Yes. The scene where all the supers came back made me teary, but when they showed spidey, i full on cried lol <|endoftext|> Lol!! I almost cried during that scene too! <|endoftext|> I wish the spiderman movies were on Disney+ <|endoftext|> I didnt realize they werent! <|endoftext|> Yeah they aren't on there. I guess the problems between Disney and Sony kept them off but I'm not completely sure why. <|endoftext|> Thats sad. Have you seen the Black Panther movie? <|endoftext|> Yes I did. It was great! I would love a panther movie from the past, like earlier in Wakanda's timeline <|endoftext|> That would be awesome!! I think one of my favorites is Ant man <|endoftext|> I haven't seen Ant-Man yet, or the Guardians movies <|endoftext|> Not even Ant Man and Wasp? <|endoftext|> Nope. I chose not to watch it because I missed the first one. <|endoftext|> You should definitely check out the first one! Its an amazing story of a man tries to turn his life around because of his little girl. Its a little different than the other marvel movies but so good! <|endoftext|> Sounds good! I will definitely watch it. <|endoftext|> Watch the trailer! I think it will catch your interest! <|endoftext|> I will! Thanks! <|endoftext|> I hope you like it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you? <|endoftext|> I am good and you? <|endoftext|> i am doing good, do you want to talk about movies? <|endoftext|> Sure! what's the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> the last movie I seen was Ford vs Ferrari. how about you? <|endoftext|> I have to admit I'm a little late right now with new releases, the last movie I saw was The Avengers Endgame (finally)  Ford vs ferrari is on my list to watch however <|endoftext|> oh nice. what kind of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> I like dramas, science fiction, action adventure / thrillers. <|endoftext|> Ok, i got a movie to recommend for you. <|endoftext|> Great! <|endoftext|> how about xmen by marvel. <|endoftext|> Which one/ <|endoftext|> X-Men Apocaylpse <|endoftext|> Oh yes I would take that recommendation! <|endoftext|> ok, that sounds good. I will recommend that movie. <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> your welcome. thank you for your assistance. <|endoftext|> I will have see where I can stream that movie. <|endoftext|> ok, that sounds good. <|endoftext|> Do you know anyplace where that streams for free? <|endoftext|> i think youtube is where I would do it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello!!! <|endoftext|> hey how's it going? <|endoftext|> Good, just Watching a movie. <|endoftext|> Oh really? Which one? I'm actually looking for something decent to watch right now. <|endoftext|> Avengers. I love all super hero movies! What abouty you? <|endoftext|> I like a lot of them but DC seems to disappoint me a lot. What is the Avengers about? Don't think i have seen that one yet. <|endoftext|> Same here. The Avengers is a team of super heros who band together to fight an evil vilian who tries to distory the world. <|endoftext|> Oh no way! Are there any superheroes i would recognize? I would hate to waste my time on some no name D list movie. <|endoftext|> Iron Man, Spider Man, Hulk, Thor, Captain America and many many more! <|endoftext|> Oh it's marvel! I'll have to pass on that one. Do you have any recommendations for a comedy? <|endoftext|> What actors do you like? <|endoftext|> Oh gosh i like a lot of them. Do you have a favorite you could reccomend? <|endoftext|> Kevin Heart is my favorit <|endoftext|> He is super funny! Do you have a favorite of his films? <|endoftext|> My daughter love the movie Secret Life of Pet 2 which he is in. It's a really cute kid movie. I really like the movie Ride Along. It'sreally funny. <|endoftext|> I have actually seen both of those already, any others? <|endoftext|> Night School? <|endoftext|> I don't think I have seen that one. Who else is in it? Can you tell me a little about it? <|endoftext|> Tiffany Haddish Is in it and SHe is the night teacher that has to teach a group of high school dropouts are forced to attend night school in hope that they'll pass the GED exam to finish high school. <|endoftext|> I love Tiffany Hadish! That sounds good I am definitively  going to watch it! <|endoftext|> I think you'll like it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you find a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi there, great! <|endoftext|> What was the latest movie you've seen in theaters <|endoftext|> Sully <|endoftext|> Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|> Yes I did. It was a great movie and I really like Tom Hanks. <|endoftext|> Yeah, Tom Hanks is great. So, in general, what types of movies to you most like? <|endoftext|> It depends on the time. I like horror, thrillers, drama, family movies, some comedy. Not that crazy slap stick stuff, but more sarcastic humor. <|endoftext|> Okay, so you have wide taste, that makes it pretty easy. Have you heard of A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. Who is in it? <|endoftext|> Tom Hanks, that's why I thought I'd suggest it. I don't know if you've heard of Mr. Rogers (from the childrens show), but its a movie about him and Tom Hanks is playing him <|endoftext|> That's what I thought after you started looking into it lol. I loved Mr. Rogers and watched it all the time when I was a kid...now I'm dating myself. I'm actually interested in that movie so I think this is a great recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great, would you be interested in seeing a trailer <|endoftext|> No, I remember the trailer that I saw once. I just couldn't remember the name of the movie. I really appreciate the recommendation and think it's a great idea to see. <|endoftext|> Okay, well i'm here to help you find a trailer you would like, so How about Ford V Ferrari. Its a great movie and it stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale in a true story about teh Le Mans races? <|endoftext|> Ohh, that sounds great. Can I see it please? <|endoftext|> Okay I sent it over, you'll probably see it after we're done chatting <|endoftext|> Sweet! Thank you. I really like both Matt Damon and Christian Bale too so that's a great fit too. Thank you again. I appreciate all you have done for me. I'm done for now. I think the recommendations you suggested were great and I'll consider both. You have a good day! <|endoftext|> Thanks a lot, I'm glad I could help. You have  a great day too and a nice upcoming weekend <|endoftext|> You too. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help you with finding a good movie! What are some of your favorite movies currently? <|endoftext|> Hi, i like to see the Irishman <|endoftext|> That's a good movie! Do you want to watch something similar to that? <|endoftext|> Sure, I enjoy movies which tell the story of real life, what do you have in mind? <|endoftext|> So you enjoy realistic movies? If you're looking for a crime/drama like The Irishman, I'd recommend Goodfellas, The Godfather, or El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. Or do you mean a non-fiction movie, like a documentary? <|endoftext|> Those are all great movies and seen them all several times. I do like documentary's too! I recently saw one about the foods we eat. I don't remember the name but was very captivating. Do you like documentary's? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do! I like documentaries that focus around mysteries. Ever since I was a baby, my mom would always be watching true crime documentaries and shows. That's probably why! Do you like true crime? <|endoftext|> Totally like them! Its amazing how they find the criminal and how they go about it. I don't like movies which are violent. Not into seeing others in pain nor want to see blood spattered which is why I have not been watching more of the true crime documentary's recently. How about you, do you like horror and gory movies? <|endoftext|> I do. I like the classic horror movies such as Scream and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I like being scared when I watch movies. However, I just don't find them scary.I think stories are the most important part to a movie, however others I talk to seem to disagree.What about you, what do you value the most when it comes to movies? <|endoftext|> I agree with you that the stories are the main ingredient in a movie. What horror movies have good stories. And can we please move this a little faster. <|endoftext|> I would recommend Get Out. Would you be interested in that? <|endoftext|> OOOO im totally afraid of that one. It seems like a very serious movie. Is there like an intro type of horror movie for peeps such as myself? <|endoftext|> How about Split? Its about a man with 23 personalities that kidnaps 3 girls. It was my first horror movie. It's more of a thriller and not so much a gore fest. Or, the original 80's IT is pretty good as well. It's quite a long one, but it is a good story. It's also not quite as scary as many of the other horror movies. Would you be interested in either of these? <|endoftext|> They sound interesting and totally worth the look. What other kinds of movies are you interested in? I'm a 56 yr old man so I can get into some of the older movies. Especially comedies! Have any favorites? <|endoftext|> I don't watch comedies as much as horror movies, but my favorite would probably South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut. It's a musical but all the songs are amazing. I remember when I was a kid I watched it with my mom, and we still quote it every day several years later! On top of that, its a great commentary on censorship, commentary that still holds up 20 years later. Would you be interested in that? <|endoftext|> I love south park and another slam dunk! Its fun to watch someones commentaries on current events with a little comedy in its thread. I did like the Mel Brooks movies in the day. I remember my Father and I laughing till it hurt watching those movies. So is there a movie that you like which is a blend between horror and comedy? <|endoftext|> I guess the old 80's IT would be an example of that. It was never intended to be a comedy. But watching it today, you're sure to get a good laugh at Pennywise! <|endoftext|> I understand what you mean. I look at the old James Bond movies and laugh on how fake the fight scense look. Is there a fight scene you like in a particular movie? <|endoftext|> I don't really watch movies with fight scenes. So you would want to watch IT? <|endoftext|> Sure I will give it a try. Keeping the remote nearby! <|endoftext|> Would you also be interested in Split? <|endoftext|> Not sure since I have never seen info on that one. <|endoftext|> We mentioned it earlier but we didn't really elaborate on it. It was about the man with 23 personalities that kidnapped 3 girls. <|endoftext|> ooo yes I do remember that so yes I will watch that too! So are we done? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, are you looking for a movie tralier? <|endoftext|> Yes I am. What are some good action movies? <|endoftext|> Terminator dark fate is a great movie. <|endoftext|> What is Terminator Dark Fate about? <|endoftext|> a newly modified liquid Terminator -- the Rev-9 model -- arrives from the future to kill a young factory worker named Dani Ramos. <|endoftext|> Thanks. Who is staring in this movie? <|endoftext|> Arnold Schwarzennger and Lisa Hamilton <|endoftext|> I'm a big fan of Arnold Schwarzennger and I do accept your recommendation. Do you have any other action movies? <|endoftext|> Rambo Last blood <|endoftext|> How does this Rambo movie compare to previous movies of this series? <|endoftext|> It's a good movie but the first Rambo is a all time classic in my eyes. <|endoftext|> I agree. I liked the original Rambo a lot. Can you tell me a little about the plot in Rambo Last Blood? <|endoftext|> Vietnam War veteran John Rambo tries to find some semblance of peace by raising horses on a ranch in Arizona. He's also developed a special familial bond with a woman named Maria and her teenage granddaughter Gabriela. But when a vicious Mexican cartel kidnaps Gabriela, Rambo crosses the border on a bloody and personal quest to rescue her and punish those responsible <|endoftext|> Sounds like a very good movie and the story is pretty good. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any other action movie that you suggest? <|endoftext|> not at this time <|endoftext|> Which of the movies that you mentioned has the better plot? <|endoftext|> Rambo plot  is way better <|endoftext|> Wow!!! I didn't expect this. Thanks. Which movie has the better cast from the tow movies that you recommended to me? <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this Rambo movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I will certainly watch the Rambo movie trailer.

Angelina Jolie is the main actress and she does not disappoint. <|endoftext|> I have seen the first but not the second. Is there anything similar to Maleficent? I enjoy female leads <|endoftext|> If you like fantasy and female leads, you will LOVE Wonder Woman! It has a great blend of fantasy and action. Would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting. Is there a movie that's similar but an older release? <|endoftext|> Bridge to Terabithia was released in 2007.

I like dialogue. <|endoftext|> We went and saw Joker last week. It's a pretty slow moving movie but I enjoyed the story. <|endoftext|> Yeah. Everyone is raving about the acting. <|endoftext|> It was pretty good. Great acting. It gave a more details into what makes the Joker the way he is. <|endoftext|> Last I saw Joequin Phoenix, he was going nuts on Dave Letterman. <|endoftext|> They say he went a little nuts getting into the Joker role. But all the past Joker's have said the same thing. <|endoftext|> Is this a good film to take the gf? Or should I save it for boys night out? <|endoftext|> It Depends on If she likes movies like that, I'm a girl and I think I enjoyed the back story of the Joker more than my Husband. <|endoftext|> I was thinking of Charlie's Angels too. The gf and her two friends used to be called that in high school. <|endoftext|> I heard that was gonna be a good movie also <|endoftext|> She also likes Angelina Jolie. Have you seen Maleficent? <|endoftext|> No not yet, It's been pretty busy with the holidays.

Different? Or simialr feel? <|endoftext|> It has a little bit of a different feel, but as the movie goes on somethings from batman are tied in. <|endoftext|> Maybe I'll give it a shot. it looks like something Psychiatrists might like. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing?

It seems that be funny is something that just comes naturally to him <|endoftext|> I completely agree. Have you seen Ace Ventura? If not, I recommend watching it. <|endoftext|> I've seen Ace Ventura Pet Detective but my boyfriend mentioned a few different ones that I haven't heard of or seen before <|endoftext|> Really? Which ones? <|endoftext|> Something about Nature, I can't recall the full title and then he mentioned a Pet Detective JR but I think he also said that Jim Carey isn't in that <|endoftext|> Oh, you are talking about Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls. That is a pretty funny movie as well. I didn't like Pet detective Jr movie that much. <|endoftext|> Yes, When Nature Calls! That's the name and my boyfriend said he didn't like it that much as well, said it wasn't as funny <|endoftext|> I thought it was funny, but I'd have to agree that it was not AS funny as the first one.

I am looking for a movie to watch. <|endoftext|> I think I can help with that. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Romantic comedies, dramas, comedies <|endoftext|> Are there any particular actors or actresses you tend to prefer? <|endoftext|> Rupert Friend, Benedict Cummberbatch, Henry Golding, Drew Barrymore, Adam Sandler <|endoftext|> A great list, for sure. How do you feel about a little adventure mixed in? <|endoftext|> Sure, I like adventure movies <|endoftext|> I've got some ideas now. While I'm thinking, what are your top 3 favorite movies off the top of your head? <|endoftext|> Crazy Rich Asians, Moulin Rogue, Kill Bill <|endoftext|> Are you a big fan of Quentin Tarantino? <|endoftext|> Yes, I like Quentin Tarantino movies <|endoftext|> It hadn't occurred to me until you mentioned Kill Bill, but Django Unchained is a pretty great adventure movie whose plot is ultimately driven by romance. Have you ever seen it? <|endoftext|> I don't remember, but it sounds like something I would like to watch or rewatch. I think that is a great recommendation. Thanks so much! <|endoftext|> No problem! <|endoftext|> I will be sure to watch this movie next <|endoftext|> Awesome. It's my personal favorite among the Tarantino films. If you're interested in something on the opposite side of the drama factor, 50 First Dates has Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler in it as well. <|endoftext|> 50 First Dates was awesome. Maybe a reason to watch it again. It has been awhile since I saw it <|endoftext|> Well if you've already seen that, you might try Bedtime Stories. I just watched that for the first time recently and I found it had all the charm of the older Sandler movies. <|endoftext|> Okay great. I have a couple of movies on my list now to watch. Thanks again <|endoftext|> No problem. Enjoy! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Christmas - since its the season LOL! <|endoftext|> Oh very nice haha, me too <|endoftext|> I can watch ELF all year long. <|endoftext|> Same here.

I'm sure you've seen Home Alone? <|endoftext|> I've have seen Home Alone - but maybe just the first few. Is there a latest Home Alone out there? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen any of the latest ones. How about National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation? <|endoftext|> I saw that one and didn't really like the adult references in the movie - I'm looking for a movie to watch with my young kiddos <|endoftext|> Ohh gotcha. How about the new Grinch movie? <|endoftext|> oh! yes I haven't seen that! Can you show me the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah sure <|endoftext|> sorry - typo. Do you know if the Grinch movie was released this year? <|endoftext|> It came out last year <|endoftext|> ok great and who is starring in that? <|endoftext|> Well it's all animated and Bendidict Cumberbatch voices the Grinch <|endoftext|> great - so I assume it is rated PG? <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's a little bit of a musical too <|endoftext|> Do you recommend anything else? Maybe I should watch 2 trailers to compare? <|endoftext|> Hmmm. Maybe Arthur Christmas <|endoftext|> Great! can you show me both? <|endoftext|> I think it'll only let me show you one <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you this evening? <|endoftext|> Hello, I am good and you? <|endoftext|> Very well, thank you! I have a question for you...what type of movies are you into? <|endoftext|> I am interested in Disney movies, comic book movies, action-films, and comedies. <|endoftext|> I love all of them also. Awesome! What was the last movie you watched..what did you like or didn't like from it? <|endoftext|> That's great! The last movie I saw was Avengers Endgame. I liked that it brought together all the Marvel heroes from the different universes to fight for a common cause. The only thing I did not like was the limitations placed on Captain Marvel's superpowers. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that movie yet and have been wanting to watch it so very bad. I know I will love it! <|endoftext|> Yes will, its really great! By the way, do you have any movie recommendations for me to see? <|endoftext|> I recently just saw Aquaman the other night and thought it was a really cool movie. Funny, suspenseful and kept me glued in. I bet you would love that movie also by the types of movies you like. Would you want to watch that movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would love to watch Aquaman! I'm a huge DC universe fan and I really like how he's getting his own origin story. I'll accept your recommendation and watch it this weekend. Thank you so much! <|endoftext|> So you would probably like to watch the movie trailer on this movie also? It will make you want to watch it even more. <|endoftext|> Yes I would watch the trailer for Aquaman :) <|endoftext|> I know you said you loved comic book type movies, so I think it will be right up your alley <|endoftext|> Yes, it would. I will be watching the trailer now. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Hope you will love it as I did. I do believe they will be coming out with a Aquaman 2 soon also. <|endoftext|> That's awesome! I'll be happy to watch both. <|endoftext|> I loved chatting with you and talking about movies <|endoftext|> I enjoyed chatting with you and talking about movies too.

Simmons, Keith David <|endoftext|> Is this an older or newer movie? <|endoftext|> its a new movie 2019 <|endoftext|> is it a long movie would like to know might want to watch it with someone <|endoftext|> the movie is about 1hour 40 mins long, the ratings is from  Internet Movie Database <|endoftext|> okay that is kind of long probably has a couple of plot twist, where does the movie take place sounds like something that would happen in chicago <|endoftext|> i also forgot to mention that it has an imdb rating of 6.5/10 <|endoftext|> ooh!!! that is no bueno I still think it will be suspenseful its probably just a slow movie. I still want to give a shot <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I want to make a movie suggestion for you. <|endoftext|> I would like to suggest Harriet <|endoftext|> What did you like from that movie? <|endoftext|> I liked the movie because it has so much history <|endoftext|> Was there anything about the movie you didn't like? <|endoftext|> I did not like how they treated the slaves <|endoftext|> I think you would also enjoy 12 Years a SLave. It is a more accurate telling of slavery from that time period. <|endoftext|> I will check out this movies thanks <|endoftext|> It has won numerous awards for Best Film. <|endoftext|> Awesome, this must be a really good movie <|endoftext|> So you are going to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes. I like the movie recommendation <|endoftext|> Here is the movie trailer for 12 Years a Slave. <|endoftext|> Thank you very much for the movie trailer for 12 Years a Slave <|endoftext|> It is highly rated on rotten tomatoes and the trailer should be on youtube. <|endoftext|> I do not like rotten tomatoes <|endoftext|> If you don't like rotten tomatoes then consider that IMDb gives it a high rating too. <|endoftext|> I reject this recommendation <|endoftext|> What is bad about the recommendation? <|endoftext|> I do not want to see a movie about rotten tomatoes <|endoftext|> Rotten Tomatoes is a movie review website not a movie. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you today <|endoftext|> Hey, I am doing good. How about you? <|endoftext|> Good to hear, good here too. <|endoftext|> I was looking for a new movie to watch actually. Would you have any good recommendations? <|endoftext|> What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Sci-fi, Comedy, normally something along those genres are my favorites. <|endoftext|> Both good genres, what was the last movie you watched. <|endoftext|> Last movie I was watching was actually a tv series called Falling Skies. <|endoftext|> I'm not familiar with that one. <|endoftext|> It's about aliens that invaded Earth. I think it was directed by Steven Spielberg. <|endoftext|> That sounds good. <|endoftext|> It is pretty interesting. I have been enjoying it. <|endoftext|> Tag is a good movie. Have you seen that one? If not I suggest watching it. <|endoftext|> I have not seen that one. Seen trailers for that one on YouTube before and it looked pretty good. I actually forgot about that one until now. I'll have to watch Tag. Thank you! <|endoftext|> Your are welcome and enjoy the movie. <|endoftext|> I'm sure that I will. <|endoftext|> Are there any other movies you have watched recently? <|endoftext|> I've watched Alita and Good Boys recently. Alita was one I really like. Good Boys was ok but not great. <|endoftext|> Nice, what is Alita about? <|endoftext|> It's about an Android that a guy finds and he rebuilds her. Alot of the movie is about her trying to find out who she is because her memories of the past are gone. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, my friend. What is going on? <|endoftext|> Hello! Just preparing everything to go back to work tomorrow. How about you? <|endoftext|> I'm good. Just came back from the theatre. I hear you need some help in selecting a movie to see. <|endoftext|> I would indeed. I was hoping that you may have some ideas on a good movie to see. <|endoftext|> What type of film do you usually like? <|endoftext|> I have several genre's that I like. I enjoy comedies that aren't silly dumb. I also like everyday neighbor type movies. <|endoftext|> Well, along the lines of the last one, there is QUOTATION_MARKA beautiful day in the neighborhoodQUOTATION_MARK. Its about Mr. Rogers. <|endoftext|> Hmmm. Who is in that one? <|endoftext|> He had a famous childrens show for a while. But he was apparantly a really interesting person in real life. It got great reviews and stars Tom Hanks. <|endoftext|> Oh, I usually like Tom Hanks. I remember a little bit about Mr. Rogers. Is it a comedy or more of a biography? <|endoftext|> It is a biography. But its funny. <|endoftext|> It sounds like something that I would enjoy. I will accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Cool. But before you go...I just rewatched QUOTATION_MARKThere's something about MaryQUOTATION_MARK. Its a classic comedy...if you want to stay at home. <|endoftext|> Is that the one with Cameron Diaz? <|endoftext|> Yes. Matt Damon and Bed Stiller too. A cameo by Brett Favre is also in there. <|endoftext|> I don't remember Brett Favre. I think the movie was a bit crude, if I remember. That's not really my thing. <|endoftext|> Well then by all means stick with a beautiful day in the neighborhood. You love it. Nothing crude about it. <|endoftext|> Do you have any other ideas for being at home? I do like to have options. <|endoftext|> You know what you might like. The Truman Show. If you like films about one's neigborhood. Its fascinating. <|endoftext|> Oh, I almost watched that one not too long ago. That has Jim Carey? <|endoftext|> Yes Jim Carrey. <|endoftext|> That one sounds good, too. I have two good options now. Thanks. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi ya, what movies have you watched lately? <|endoftext|> I like old movies. The last one I watched was the disney movie That Darn Cat and it was great <|endoftext|> Nice is that the kind of movie you prefer? <|endoftext|> Yeah and I also like animated movies <|endoftext|> If I recall that movie was made in the 60's it still holds up today for sure! <|endoftext|> Disney made some good live action movies in that era, but I like all kinds of disney stuff <|endoftext|> I remember the Witch Mountain movies, those were pretty good. <|endoftext|> I think I only saw the remake of that one, maybe I should watch the original <|endoftext|> The first one was Escape to Witch Mountain, it came out in 1975. <|endoftext|> I will check that one out then <|endoftext|> Return from Witch Mountain actually has Bette Davis in it, would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Oh nice! Yes I will watch it <|endoftext|> It also has Christopher Lee and Kim Richards. I was incorrect it came out in 1978. My bad! <|endoftext|> Ah well you were close. I didn't know Christopher Lee was in it. <|endoftext|> Would you like a quick plot summary? <|endoftext|> Sure that would be good <|endoftext|> Basically it is about a brother and sister named Tony and Tia who have telekinetic powers and some unscrupulous people who want to use them for nefarious means. It is about their adventures. <|endoftext|> I remember their names being different in the remake. Anyway I will definitely check that out <|endoftext|> Yes I think the remake took a few liberties from the original, there are actually a couple of them from back then, the first one did pretty well. <|endoftext|> The original is probably better, remakes are hardly ever better <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am good, how are you doing? <|endoftext|> I'm well thanks, just trying to keep warm. Was just thinking about the cozy chairs in the last movie theater I was in. Have you been to a movie recently? <|endoftext|> yes i went last friday to see knives out <|endoftext|> oh wonderful! did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|> I did. it was very interesting and kept me thinking the whole time. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> I have not but it looks very good. I like comedies and that seems to have some funny one-liners in it <|endoftext|> it does have some good one-liners in it. I am a big fan of mysteries, and trying to figure out what happened throughout the movie. <|endoftext|> If you liked that so much, you would also like QUOTATION_MARKThe Good Liar.QUOTATION_MARK I am a big fan of Helen Mirren. Have you seen that? <|endoftext|> I have not seen that, but I will definitely look into that. I am always looking for new movies to watch. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> My pleasure! Have a great rest of the day! <|endoftext|> Thanks, you too! Happy holidays to you! <|endoftext|> You too! I have the trailer here for you to watch when you have a moment. <|endoftext|> Yes, please send it to me <|endoftext|> So sorry for the delay. I am having a small technical difficulty getting it to you. <|endoftext|> No problem. I can search it on my computer <|endoftext|> okay great. It was released this year, 2019. You can also use Ian McKellen's name to search as well. He's another awesome actor in the movie. <|endoftext|> Looks great I will probably watch tonight <|endoftext|> Awesome. Again so sorry for the computer issue I'm having. Have a great day. <|endoftext|> Thanks, you too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I am here to recommend a movie to you! What types of genres do you like? <|endoftext|> Hi, Thanks for being here. I like family dramas. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Wonder? It is a about a boy who had facial differences that didn't allow him to go to a normal school, and as other people around him struggle, he is the glue who holds it all once he gets into the fifth grade <|endoftext|> I have heard about the book. Haven't watched the movie. From details it looks very emotional. Does the movie have humor element? <|endoftext|> It has a slight humor taste but nothing major. Is that what you look for when searching for a movie? <|endoftext|> Slight humor works fine. Is it good to watch with kids? <|endoftext|> I would say that it could be slightly emotional, but it is a great movie to watch with the family for sure. So many lessons taught and important ones too! <|endoftext|> Ok. I accept this movie recommendation. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes. before that do you have any other suggestion? <|endoftext|> I definitely could. What are other things that you look for in movies? <|endoftext|> some romantic new movies? <|endoftext|> Ah sorry, I'm not too well endowed with Romantic movies. What other genres do you like? <|endoftext|> one more family oriented movie. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Incredibles or Incredibles 2? Definitely one that incorporates the whole family and is a blast to watch with kids. Action, with humor, and overall great. <|endoftext|> no. I haven't. Is both the stories connected. Or like second part is continuation of the first part.? <|endoftext|> They are connected through plotlines and all. In fact, Incredibles 2 came out over 10 years after the first one was made so the animation is so different but both are great. Do you like animated movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do. In fact my kids love animated movies. <|endoftext|> This is perfect then! <|endoftext|> Thank you. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Perfect, would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I am here to help recommend a movie to you. <|endoftext|> Yes I'd like a recommendation for a movie. <|endoftext|> What kind of movie are you looking for? <|endoftext|> I really like comedies. <|endoftext|> What is your favorite comedy? <|endoftext|> I really liked Adam Sandler in Happy Gilmore <|endoftext|> So would you like me to recommend a comedy that is similar to that movie? <|endoftext|> Yeah for sure <|endoftext|> I think you might like Caddyshack. <|endoftext|> I've seen that before and it's really good. <|endoftext|> If you liked Caddyshack, you might also like Stripes. <|endoftext|> I've never seen Stripes before. I think I'll choose that one. <|endoftext|> It stars Bill Murray, and is a comedy about him and his friends joining the army. <|endoftext|> Yeah that sounds good. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it! It's a really funny movie so I'm eager to hear what you think. <|endoftext|> Yeah I'm excited to check out the trailer. <|endoftext|> Hope you like it and that my recommendation was good! <|endoftext|> Yeah me too <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good evening! How are you? I would love to assist you with finding a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> I'm good. How are you? <|endoftext|> I am good, thanks! What movie genres do you like? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds but my favorite genres are horror and comedy <|endoftext|> Nice! What was the last movie you watched for either horror or comedy (unless it was a horror comedy)? <|endoftext|> The last horror movie I saw was called Haunt. It was about a group of college kids that go to one of those halloween haunted houses but it turns out that the stuff happening in it is real. Really good flick <|endoftext|> That sounds really interesting. Is that the type of movie you would like to see a trailer on today? <|endoftext|> That would be great. Its hard to find a decent horror movie these days <|endoftext|> I know what you mean. The lead in that was also on American Idol, which is a neat trivia tidbit! <|endoftext|> Wow thats crazy lol <|endoftext|> I was thinking of a trailer that I thought might fit your interests. <|endoftext|> Lay it on me, let's see what you got <|endoftext|> LOL! I was curious if you liked the psychological aspect or just straight up horror more? <|endoftext|> I like both, but I think I'd like straight up horror more. <|endoftext|> I was thinking about Haunt and the younger cast and a movie with a bit of twist. <|endoftext|> That sounds exactly like what I would like. The tough part is finding a good one <|endoftext|> I think this one might be worth a shot if you are ready? <|endoftext|> Yep I'm ready <|endoftext|> Awesome. The movie is QUOTATION_MARKTruth or DareQUOTATION_MARK featuring Lucy Hale of Pretty Little Liars fame. <|endoftext|> Oh I know that girl. She's hot lol. I'll check it out <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, happy Monday! What's the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Happy Monday :) last movie I watched was Train to Busan <|endoftext|> Ooo, that's kind of a scary zombie sort of movie isn't it? Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|> yes! it was pretty good! <|endoftext|> That's cool, I'll have to add that one to my list. Have you seen any good movie trailers lately? Anything exciting coming out? <|endoftext|> I saw the trailer for Knives Out recently, that looked pretty good. What about you? <|endoftext|> I recently saw a trailer for a movie called QUOTATION_MARKAntebellumQUOTATION_MARK. I think it may be a Jordan Peele film? I'm not sure but it gave me QUOTATION_MARKGet OutQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKUsQUOTATION_MARK vibes. I'd recommend you check out the trailer if you haven't seen it yet. <|endoftext|> YES. I feel like I keep saying everything is pretty good...but the movie trailer looks amazing <|endoftext|> Haha, it really does look amazing! This conversation makes me want to go watch the trailer again. Do you think you'll end up watching it again today? <|endoftext|> Yes, I think I will---thank you for your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Trying to find a movie right now that would be similar to stay hyped up until QUOTATION_MARKAntebellumQUOTATION_MARK is released. There's a movie form 2016 called QUOTATION_MARKThe Birth of a NationQUOTATION_MARK. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> No I haven't <|endoftext|> Oh ok, check out the trailer for that one whenever you get a chance. Around this time of year, I feel like I end up watching movies too much. Around the holidays, I like to get away from family get togethers and run out to a theater or just plop down in front of the tv. <|endoftext|> Haha I wish I could do that! I watch a lot of netflix. What's better than chilling at home with 1000 blankets and putting together your own movie marathon? <|endoftext|> YESSSSSSS. Full on wrap yourself up in a blanket burrito, I agree, there is nothing better! Is it cold where you are right now? It's unseasonably warm today but I'd still bust out a sofa blanket for a good tv binge. <|endoftext|> Yes, cold and snowing D: we're looking at 10 inches by this afternoon. <|endoftext|> Oh wow! That is serious weather. I couldn't live like that. Cold and snow make me want to eat everything haha. I would be snacking so much and drinking ALL the cocoa.. Does that happen to you? Do you have any particular cold weather snacks that you like to have? <|endoftext|> ugh, there's too many snacks to choose from esp now that we are in holiday cookie season. umm cookies and hot chocolate of course. <|endoftext|> Yeah, whatever bit of self discipline I had has now gone out of the window haha <|endoftext|> yes, we are in the seasonal black hole of dieting. lol no point trying to do anything until after new years. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> yes <|endoftext|> What sort of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> ironman <|endoftext|> That's a good movie! Are you into superhero movies in general? or just that one in particular? <|endoftext|> iron man1 <|endoftext|> Have you seen any more recent movies that you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> nice movie <|endoftext|> Well, there's no doubt that action movies are a lot of fun and can tell a good story as well. <|endoftext|> action and fun movie <|endoftext|> Since you like Iron Man and action movies, I would recommend Avengers: Endgame. It includes Iron Man as well as a slew of other super heroes all teaming up to fight a common enemy. It's very exciting and fun. Would you like to view the trailer? <|endoftext|> avengers endgame is a super movie <|endoftext|> It sure is. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I think Robert Downey Jr. was excellent in it. As was Scarlett Johanssen. <|endoftext|> Downey is a good actor <|endoftext|> If you have already seen Avengers: Engame, would you like me to recommend a different movie? <|endoftext|> jumanji the nex level <|endoftext|> You would like to see a trailer for Jumanji The Next Level? Or is this another movie you enjoy? <|endoftext|> spiderman home coming <|endoftext|> It sounds like you're really into action movies. Have you seen any classic 80's Schwarzenegger movies? They are a lot of fun, but a bit dated nowadays. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any classic 80's Schwarzenegger movies? no sir <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch a trailer for Commando? It is ridiculous. It has tons of action and some humor too. <|endoftext|> action and some humor  movie <|endoftext|> Ok. I would strongly recommend you view the trailer for Commando. I think you would like it. <|endoftext|> yes good <|endoftext|> Great! I'll let you get to that and I really hope you enjoy it. Have a good day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you? I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. Thank you. <|endoftext|> Great! What type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like action and comedy the most. I'm easy because I can like all types. <|endoftext|> What is the latest movie you have watched? Both of those genres are awesome.. <|endoftext|> Well I recently watched Equalizer 2...I love all the John Wicks. I'm been wanting to watch the movie Lucy with Scarlet Johanson. n <|endoftext|> I haven't seen Equalizer 2, but it sounds very good! Lucy also is on my list of movies to see. What did you like about Equalizer 2? <|endoftext|> umm...Denzel is AMAZING :)  I like pretty much all the movies he's in. <|endoftext|> He is sooooo great!!! One of my favorite actors <|endoftext|> yes, I like the movie:  Book of Eli, with Denzel. He is very talented. I also like comedies. Like...Internship with Vince Vahn and Owen Wilson. Those two are classic. <|endoftext|> Oh, yes! Or Wedding Crashers with Vince Vahn and Owen Wilson as well. Both classics! <|endoftext|> haha, yes. now we are on the same page. I also like Alec Baldwin in The Departed with Leo. That movie is great.\\ <|endoftext|> I highly recommend Vantage Point with Sigourney Weaver and Dennis Quaid. It's action-packed, and it shows the same crime from various perspectives. Putting together the pieces from each character's viewpoint helps the audience to solve the mystery of who committed the crime! <|endoftext|> Wow...I just looked it up and it looks really good. I will definitely watch that movie. Thank you for your time and have a great holiday season :) <|endoftext|> So glad! Hope you get a chance to watch it. It will absolutely be entertaining! Hope you have a great holiday season as well, it was wonderful chatting with you and learning more about your movie preferences! <|endoftext|> Yes.

I've been watching the Watchmen on HBO which is also a DC film like the Joker. It's very distracting at times. <|endoftext|> Definitely! What is the Watchmen about? <|endoftext|> The Watchmen is about an alternat universe where the superhere Dr.Manhattan helped win the vietnam war. Cops wear costumes in Tulsa, OK and  Robert Redford is president. <|endoftext|> Wow sounds so interesting <|endoftext|> Yes, the cinematography is also done very well.

What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Maleficent 2 was the last movie I watched in a movie theatre. The last movie I watched at home was probably a super hero movie. <|endoftext|> We just went and saw Frozen 2! It was wonderful. Disney movies are always great no matter how old you are.

Do you have any ideas such as what type of movie you will watch? <|endoftext|> I like thrillers, how about you? <|endoftext|> Well. Sometimes, I also like thrillers. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Law Abiding Citizen with Gerard Butler? <|endoftext|> Actually not,but I've heard it before. It was released in 2009, right? <|endoftext|> Yes it was. If you like anything with a mystery and that has that thrilling aspect it is an awesome movie. I think it is on Netflix now you should give a shot. <|endoftext|> Ok. Good. If I have time, I will watch it. <|endoftext|> It really is that good. It is a shame because it really did not get that much hype at the time <|endoftext|> So, you are saying you will watch a movie tonight, you will go to cinema to watch or watch at home? <|endoftext|> At home tonight. what about you? <|endoftext|> I will watch movie at home either.

I'd love to get a recommendation! <|endoftext|> Which type of movies do you like to watch? adventure? horror? comedy? <|endoftext|> I love horror. Those movies are my favorite. I especially like the ones that are sort of an atmospheric, slow burn (and love when things are open to interpretation) <|endoftext|> Horror is my favorite as well. Please give me a minute to see what is out! <|endoftext|> No worries! If it helps, ghost movies are my favorite (but I'll pretty much watch any type of horror) <|endoftext|> Scary stories to tell in the dark   is out now. It is about a a little girl that writes scary that come alive. I hear it is pretty good. <|endoftext|> Yeah! I've actually been meaning to check it out. I used to read the books when I was a kid.

I hope you enjoy <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> You are welcome.If that doesnt work out check out 'It chapter 2QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Awesome! I saw the first one when it came out. I thought it was funnier than it was scary, but I still enjoyed it. Thanks for that recommendation too! I also accept it (but will check out Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark first, lol)! <|endoftext|> The first one was really good <|endoftext|> Yeah, I thought the actors did a great job! I'm interested in seeing how they focus on their adult versions in the second one. Have you seen it (the second one that is)? <|endoftext|> I have not. I am going to wait until it comes out on dvd.lol <|endoftext|> lol, good idea. Well, thanks again! These were great recommendations! <|endoftext|> Im sorry to keep this going. I am glad you are a good sport <|endoftext|> Haha, no worries! Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> 3 from hell. However it is a Rob zombie movie. There is a mixed view from people on his movies. <|endoftext|> Haha, you're right about the mixed view. The only movie of his that I've seen is his version of Halloween. I remember it being alright. I accept the recommendation (but would probably watch the other two first lol). <|endoftext|> great! have a wonderful night! <|endoftext|> You too! Nice chatting with you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there. I am here to help you look for a new movie to watch. Do you know of what kind of movie you are interested in? <|endoftext|> Hello! I love comedies! Have you seen any good ones lately? <|endoftext|> I am actually looking to possibly go see the movie Jumanji; The next level. Looks really good and has a really good cast in it. <|endoftext|> Oh I had no idea there was another Jumanji movie out! That sounds awesome! Who is in the cast? <|endoftext|> Big actors such as, Dwayne Johnson (the rock), Kevin Hart. They are huge actors and always bring a real comical approach to movies. <|endoftext|> I love them both! Sounds like a good one to see! Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> You definitely welcome! You should check out the trailer for that movie. It's really funny! <|endoftext|> I will defintely do that now! Thanks! I def accept the recommendation and will go check the trailer for it now! Thank you so much! <|endoftext|> you are welcome.

Have you seen the new Christmas movie thats out? I apologize, I cant think of the name <|endoftext|> This one comes out next week. December 13th. There is another Christmas movie that comes out the same day as Jumanji called Black Christmas. Are you thinking of that one? <|endoftext|> No, I don't think thats it.. Its more of a romantic comedy I believe . My daughter wants to see it. <|endoftext|> Is it called Last Christmas? <|endoftext|> That may be it. Have you seen that? <|endoftext|> I have not seen that movie yet, no. But it looks like it may be good. Emma Thompson is in it. <|endoftext|> I have no clue who she is lol  When did you say the new Jumanji is out ? Is it now or next week? <|endoftext|> December 13th. Next week. <|endoftext|> ok, awesome! Thank you again! I will go check it out! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> How's it going? <|endoftext|> Great. What genre of movies do you love? <|endoftext|> SciFi, Action, Fantasy, Horror <|endoftext|> For horror, do you enjoy scares or a more suspenseful ride throughout the film? <|endoftext|> Suspenseful rides are better. <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of The Others or Silence of the Lambs? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen The Others, but yes I love Silence of the Lambs. <|endoftext|> Cool. For horror, I would recommend the movie The Witch starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Hereditary starring Toni Collette. <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of that one, so I will give it a shot! <|endoftext|> For sci-fi, Ex Machina starring Oscar Isaac(Poe from Star Wars) is probably one of the best in recent years <|endoftext|> I have been considering watching that one for a while, I'll have to give it a shot if you are recommending it. <|endoftext|> Great movie about robot singularity. What are your favorite fantasy movies? <|endoftext|> I have a wide taste when it comes to fantasy: Willow, the Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Clash of the Titans, Lady Hawk, Highlander, Sleepy Hollow, all of the Lord of the Rings movies and spin offs of course. <|endoftext|> Not to familiar with fantasy, but I absolutely loved Pan's Labyrinth. I'll jot down those movies to watch soon. <|endoftext|> Pan's Labyrinth was pretty awesome! <|endoftext|> Great acting and loved the practical effects. <|endoftext|> I remember it being a little messed up too, which is always refreshing. I think directors and scriptwriters are afraid to go off the beaten path. <|endoftext|> Exactly! Thank God for Guillermo del Toro <|endoftext|> Right?! Love both the books and the tv show of The Strain, good horror/not sexy vampire <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> hi. Can you reccommend a movie? <|endoftext|> Yes.

What was the last movie you enjoyed watching? <|endoftext|> the joker <|endoftext|> Ah yes that was a really great movie. The acting was brilliant, joaquinn was amazing. What did you enjoy the most about that movie? <|endoftext|> i think it was a amazing movie, outstanding acting , the story was ver well written . one of the best movies <|endoftext|> Would you like me to recommend a movie with a similar tone to the Joker? I know of one that while isn't quite as socially reflective, it's still a very emotional superhero movie. <|endoftext|> yeah i am also ver open to other types of movies. <|endoftext|> Ah ok great! Well I would recommend trying Logan with Hugh Jackman. It definitely was not the typical comic book movie, and had strong emotional tones. What do you think? <|endoftext|> is it the 2017 film ? <|endoftext|> Yes, have you seen it already? <|endoftext|> yes i have, its kind of an old movie was released in 2017 . Do you have any other recomendation ? <|endoftext|> Yes, how about The Irishman with Robert Deniro. It's about a mob hitman and how he goes about killing Jimmy Hoffman. <|endoftext|> that one i will have to look it up , i dont think i have seen it <|endoftext|> ok check it out and see what you think <|endoftext|> seems to be a pretty good movie, it has a 96% rating from rotten tomatoe <|endoftext|> Great, is it ok if I go ahead and select that movie for you then? <|endoftext|> yeah , sure <|endoftext|> Great I selected it, I really hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> thank you so much for the recomendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi i am here to help you <|endoftext|> Im looking for a movie recommendation <|endoftext|> whats the last movie have you seen <|endoftext|> I saw Ford vs Ferrari <|endoftext|> oh its james film .nice movie <|endoftext|> Yeah, all the acting was spectacular and they didn't over dramatize everything <|endoftext|> whats your favourite gener <|endoftext|> Science fiction is my favorite, but I like just about everything <|endoftext|> ok i will help you find a film .now are you interested in any specific geners <|endoftext|> Science fiction and comedy <|endoftext|> have you ever seen annihilation <|endoftext|> yes, it was really good <|endoftext|> do you want to see similar kind of movie <|endoftext|> Yes, i would love something like that <|endoftext|> ok have you seen any of this movie edge of tomorrow,elysium,arrival,the matirx <|endoftext|> I seen all except Edge of Tomorrow <|endoftext|> oh edge of tomorrow is a scientific adventure film .i personally liked a lot <|endoftext|> Ill have to check it out.

Thank you. <|endoftext|> thanks for accepting my recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, how are you doing? I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Great! Do you know of any romantic comedies? <|endoftext|> Yes, the Long Shot with Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron came out earlier this year and was great! <|endoftext|> I never heard of that one but I like Charlize Theron, she is usually in good movies. Can you tell me a little about it? <|endoftext|> The two leads are opposites, but are brought together by their careers. They bond when they realize that Charlize Theron's cahracter was Seth Rogan's character's baby sitter. Seth Rogan is in his typical stoner role, but it doesn't come off contrived. Charlize Theron plays a sophisticated diplomat. <|endoftext|> Oh that sounds good, I think I will watch it. Thanks for the good recommendation! <|endoftext|> Thank you. I think you'll enjoy the movie a lot! Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would! <|endoftext|> Got it! I will get you the movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> Okay, I have selected Long Shot as your trailer. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> Thanks! I just watched it and it looks like a great movie. I will be watching it soon for sure! Do you like these kinds of movies as well? <|endoftext|> Great! I knew you would like it, it's a good romcom and the actors are hilarious. I like to watch romcoms every once in awhile. They can be predictable, but always funny. <|endoftext|> How about drama's, can you recommend a good drama? <|endoftext|> The recent Joker movie that came out has great critical acclaim and is an intense drama. <|endoftext|> Is it scary at all? I don't really like scary movies! <|endoftext|> Yes, it's pretty scary. How about The Irishman? It's a Scorsese crime drama that came out just last week. The cast includes  Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. <|endoftext|> Yes, that sounds kind of interesting! I like Robert De Niro and Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. I haven't seen a movie like that in awhile. Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Great! Here's the trailer for the Irishman, if you'd like to watch it. <|endoftext|> Thank you for all of your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hi, I, looking to take my young ones to a movie this weekend, looking for family friendly. <|endoftext|> I have young ones too. I think I can guess that Frozen might be on the list? <|endoftext|> I think so too, looking that th first one was so great <|endoftext|> My daughter absolutely loves Olaf from the first one. Do yours have a favorite character? <|endoftext|> Elsa herself....half her wardrobe is elsa stuff <|endoftext|> Awesome choice. I have been getting lots of Facebook posts from all of her cousins that have seen Frozen 2. Have yours seen any new releases yet? <|endoftext|> quite difficult with little ones, we tried lady and the tramp but both kept fuzzing. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I count on only making half the movie. I still haven't seen the end to How to Tame Your Dragon. Well since she loves Elsa, Frozen 2 is your best bet. <|endoftext|> yeah i think so. She warched the first one last wwek and did not moved at all <|endoftext|> I need to go back and watch the first again <|endoftext|> Yeah that will be good. May buy tickets this afternoon <|endoftext|> Are there any children's movies you didn't like? <|endoftext|> i liked all the disneys and pixar movies <|endoftext|> I remember Wall-E from way back. Him holding out that lone little flower to her was a scene I still remember, that and the Toy Story franchise <|endoftext|> toy story is gold. i grew up with that movie <|endoftext|> Animation has really been able to capture emotion. These movies are incredible. You have a favorite? <|endoftext|> The original toy story and Monsters Inc <|endoftext|> I almost forgot about Mike! Classic. <|endoftext|> yes it is... Might watch it with the young ones later again <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> I just saw Dora the Explorer. Good family flick! <|endoftext|> that sounds good which character did you like the best <|endoftext|> I liked Dora, she was sincere and genuine <|endoftext|> would it be a good movie to bring kids to? <|endoftext|> It is great for teens or middle school kids. Younger ones may be a little scared <|endoftext|> who were some of the actors in it? <|endoftext|> Jeff Wahlberg played Diego. <|endoftext|> oh i like him. I may have to see it next time i go to a movie <|endoftext|> Yes, it's a fun movie with the excitement of Indiana Jones but at a teenager level <|endoftext|> sounds great thanks for the suggestion. I saw ford vs ferrari and highly recommend it <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting. What is it about? <|endoftext|> it is based on a true story of the ford motor companies building a race car to beat ferrari <|endoftext|> who is in it <|endoftext|> christian bale and matt damon were the main characters <|endoftext|> Oh, I like Matt Damon. <|endoftext|> he was great. He played carol shelby <|endoftext|> Did they succeed in building the car? <|endoftext|> they did and ended up winning the race in the end <|endoftext|> Oh, cool sounds like a great movie. I'll accept your recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> That's great. I have been wanting some recommendations. <|endoftext|> ohh cool, which type of movies you like most???? <|endoftext|> I like documentaries. <|endoftext|> then you may try about geographical documentries about valcano <|endoftext|> Something a little different like biographys or maybe music related <|endoftext|> then what about starting periods of music and traditinal languages of countries and the history about it <|endoftext|> I would not be interested in traditional languages. Mayby a history documentary. <|endoftext|> then we may go for musical history how it became a part of our life also <|endoftext|> For music related topics I would be interested in blues music but maybe something different for history <|endoftext|> ohhh in which one that you interested to see in historical documentry <|endoftext|> yes. some sort of historical movie might be interesting too. <|endoftext|> then i suggest you a movie dunkirk it will be a good choice <|endoftext|> I have never heard of that. what is that about <|endoftext|> Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire, and France are surrounded by the German Army, and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II. <|endoftext|> I would rather not see a war  related movie. <|endoftext|> then u may see Lincoln which was a good movie <|endoftext|> do you have a music documentary movie maybe about a popular band or historical band <|endoftext|> Score: A Film Music Documentary. It will be great documentry about music <|endoftext|> okay I will give that movie a try. thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How're you today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing fantastic! <|endoftext|> Great! What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Frozen 2 in theaters <|endoftext|> Did you enjoy it? What was your favorite part? <|endoftext|> It was definitely a great family film! My favorite part was when Krystoff was singing his solo part and it sounded like an 80's ballad. It was hilarious <|endoftext|> Oh my goodness, that sounds like a really fun time! I really liked the first one, I haven't gotten around to seeing the second one yet! Was there anything you disliked? <|endoftext|> I can't recall any parts that i disliked actually. You should check it out especially if you have small children. <|endoftext|> How rare is that! I'll definitely have to check it out then! I'm a huge fan of Disney myself :) <|endoftext|> I'm easy to please when it comes to movies. I love Disney as well. We even have the new app and I've been binge watching all of the vault classics.\\ <|endoftext|> Oh gosh that's so awesome, I've been looking into getting that as well! Do you like any other genres? I'm a huge comedy fan myself. <|endoftext|> I do in fact, Another movie I just watched was The Kitchen. Based off of three women who have husbands in Irish mafia. Such a great film also. Do you know of any other movies similar to that? <|endoftext|> That sounds really good! If you like movies about women and crime, you might like Widows! It's set in contemporary Chicago. Four women are left with their husband's massive debt after they all mysteriously die from criminal activities. They have to take matters into their own hands and do things on their own terms! Would you be interested in that? <|endoftext|> Yes! That sounds really good! Thank you! I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> I really like a lot of different crime movies like that and women empowerment! <|endoftext|> I love a movie with a strong female lead for sure. Any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Hmm, I would say that the movie Hustlers may also interest you! It depicts a band of women that scheme and trick Wall Street men out of money! It has a lot of big name stars including J-Lo, Lizzo, Cardi B and Lili Reinhart! <|endoftext|> Oh wow, Cardi B in a movie haha! I'll check that one out too! <|endoftext|> I know, right? It also has KeKe Palmer and Julia Stiles as well. But based upon your interest in The Kitchen, I think Widows might be the most similar! Personally, I just love watching downtrodden women taking their lives back, to be honest. So often women are forced to be in submissive roles, so it's cool to see women kicking butt! <|endoftext|> Yes! I completely agree! I loved your recommendations and I will most certainly check them out! Thank you! <|endoftext|> I appreciate you accepting the recommendations, and I hope you have a lovely day!:) <|endoftext|> You as well! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello how are you? <|endoftext|> i am good ..how are you? <|endoftext|> i am great, what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like mystery, thriller and of late i have been interested in watching the dystopian genre ones <|endoftext|> have you ever seen the hunger games? <|endoftext|> I have , do you have any other recommendation similar to hunger games <|endoftext|> yes, there is a movie called maze runner <|endoftext|> have seen that too <|endoftext|> what about divergent? <|endoftext|> Havent seen that...is it a series ,, can you share more details? <|endoftext|> Plot:  In a world divided by factions based on virtues, Tris learns she's Divergent and won't fit in.

My personal favorite is La La Land, because it is both a drama and comedy. <|endoftext|> The last movie i saw was Geronimo, i enjoyed it because of the action and drama. What is La La Land about? <|endoftext|> La La Land is about Ryan Gosling playing a struggling jazz musician who falls in love with Emma Stone who's a barista aspiring to become an actress. It's a musical as well, so there's a lot of singing. <|endoftext|> I see, sounds interesting, but for me i enjoy movies more centered around action, do you have any reccomendations <|endoftext|> Yes, Mission Impossible: Fallout is the best action movie I've seen thus far. You cannot go wrong with Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane and chasing after bad guys. <|endoftext|> Wow, i definitely find that interesting, what is the plot about? How is Tom Cruise's acting in that movie compared to others? <|endoftext|> Tom Cruise does some of his best stuff in Mission Impossible: Fallout, but the best of the Mission:Impossible series is Ghost Protocol. Fallout is interesting because it shows Tom Cruise as an older man who is still trying to keep up with the action of chasing bad guys. <|endoftext|> That sound's like a fantastic movie, i will definitely will check it out sometime! Thank you very much for that recommendation! <|endoftext|> No problem. Hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> I will, by chance do you know of any other movies that involve drama? <|endoftext|> Yes, there's quite a few. If you want drama and action, I would recommend the Jason Bourne series. Matt Damon does a good job of balancing both the action and drama as he finds out about his past. <|endoftext|> What other notable actor's and actress's are on  the Jason Bourne Series? <|endoftext|> There's Chris Cooper, Julia Stiles, and instead of Matt Damon the fourth movie in the series The Bourne Legacy stars Jeremy Renner. <|endoftext|> That is pretty awesome, is enjoy movies like that. I mainly watch movies about Native Americans, do you know of any movies similar to something like that? <|endoftext|> Yes, Dances with Wolves is a good one. I watched it a long time back, but I recall the story was quite interesting. It's about an Army officer who runs into a band of Native Americans after his stint in the army. <|endoftext|> I have heard of that, that sounds around more of my taste in movies, i will check that out recommendation! Do you know of any other similar movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, there's also Last of the Mohicans, which is based on a popular book. It's about a frontiersman who learns to live with the Native Americans. <|endoftext|> I have seen that movie, it is interesting because of the conflict between the Native Americans and European's. <|endoftext|> Yes, but the movie also does a good job of showing how Native Americans and Europeans can get along as well. <|endoftext|> That is very true! Friendship seems prevalent throughout history. I gladly will follow up on your recommendations. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how may i help you today? <|endoftext|> hi i am looking for a good movie to go see today <|endoftext|> Ah my specialty!

Thank you <|endoftext|> Anytime enjoy! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today? <|endoftext|> I am very well. Actually I'm bored and looking for a movie to watch. <|endoftext|> I saw a fantastic movie this weekend with my granddaughter. It was Frozen 2. Have you seen a movie recently? <|endoftext|> I have seen a lot of movies. I don't mind animation but it's far from my favorite genre. <|endoftext|> I enjoy all movies. What is your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Horror is my favorite genre but I'm not big on gore. I like dramas like gangster and war movies. I also like comedies but humor is so subjective. <|endoftext|> I also watched Road House this past week. It is an older movie. The longer I watched it, the more I realized they would never produce a movie like that nowadays. Do you have a favorite movie? Mine, I would have to say is Dances with Wolves. <|endoftext|> It's been a long time since I've seen Road House. I like so many that I can't pick a favorite. I love The Thing, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Fright Night, Goodfellas, Platoon. Recently I really enjoyed Joker and Doctor Sleep. <|endoftext|> Two of my favorite actors are in Road House. Sam Elliott and Patrick Swayze! You know, you said you like horror. Have you watched the Ring? That movie gave me the creeps. If you haven't seen it, the movie trailer will give you a good idea of what it is about. <|endoftext|> I have but only the original Japanese one and the American remake. None of the sequels. I like Sam Elliott in The Big Lebowski a lot. <|endoftext|> How about Paranormal Activity? Would you like to see the trailer for that movie? It was creepy! <|endoftext|> I have seen that one. It was very creepy. I know some people don't like hand held or shaky cam movies but it never bothered me. <|endoftext|> It doesn't really bother me either. Depends on the film though! I have a huge collection of thrillers. That is my favorite genre, unless I am down in the dumps, then I watch some comedy! The Changeling was also a good movie. Did you see that one? It was back in the 70's I believe. <|endoftext|> I did. I do like ghost movies. The Shining is fantastic. Do you have any recommendations in that sub-genre? <|endoftext|> I love the psychological horror films. Silence of the Lambs? I am sure you have seen that. <|endoftext|> Yes. I do like those kind of horror thrillers as well though. Do you have a more recent ghost or psychological horror recommendations? <|endoftext|> Don't Let Go!! It didn't get the best reviews but I enjoyed it <|endoftext|> I have not seen that one. I would love to check it out. I have never even heard of it. <|endoftext|> So you would like to watch the movie trailer? I am sure you would like it, because we seem to like the same movies. <|endoftext|> It does seem that we have similar tastes. I would love to see the trailer. Thank you so much for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> Have a nice day! Enjoy the trailer. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Hi how are you my besti movie is finding Nemo I really like it <|endoftext|> Oh, nice.

I really like Disney's more recent princesses. They are strong and independent women instead of the traditional helpless women. <|endoftext|> Ya I am totally agree with that these are just imaginations but make us think about our life that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds we want to be like them I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt like horror <|endoftext|> Ok.

They are super secretive mercenaries. One gets a baby yoda as part of his mission and end up kidnapping it to keep it safe and is now on the run. <|endoftext|> Mmm not of my type do you have any other recommendations of some cute and full of life movie <|endoftext|> Sure! do you like the live action Disney remakes? <|endoftext|> Yup some how <|endoftext|> Have you seen the new Lady and the Tramp <|endoftext|> No what is it about <|endoftext|> It's about a female dog named Lady. Her family has a baby and she runs away with a stray named Tramp out of jealousy. They have lots of adventures and get into plenty of trouble together. They also learn the meaning of family and go live with Lady's family together. <|endoftext|> Woo sounds good I definitely want to see this <|endoftext|> You should definitely watch it! I selected it for you to watch :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> good evening. how are you? looking for a good movie to watch? <|endoftext|> Good thanks! How are you? I would love to find a good movie to watch. Can you help? <|endoftext|> I'm great. I'm a big movie lover and would love to help you out.

I like Avengers and Marvel Spiderman a lot <|endoftext|> oh wow. you surprised me with the superheros! A good recent drama I would recommend would be the art of racing in the rain.

I like that it has parts of different types of movies in it. So it is a bit of everything instead of being pigeon holed in one genre or story. <|endoftext|> Please tell me more! <|endoftext|> the lead actor is a race car driver. he has a dog whose thoughts we can hear by the voice of kevin costner. amanda seyfriend is the love interest. not sure if you would know her or not. she's sort of popular. <|endoftext|> I'm not familiar with her, but I like Kevin Costner <|endoftext|> yeah, I like his work too...especially his westerns. he does a great job being the voice of the dog. It sounds a little silly that we hear the dogs voice, but it is actually quite fun and touching. <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> awesome. I encourage you to check out the trailer just to confirm :) <|endoftext|> Great Thanks so much for the recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> yeah, I want a girl's night out with my best friend.

How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am doing ok, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Pretty good. I'm looking forward to talking about movies, one of my favorite subjects. <|endoftext|> Same here. What types of movies do you usually watch? & what movie is your all time favorite? <|endoftext|> I like drama, action and comedy movies the most. My favorite movie is QUOTATION_MARK2001: A Space OdysseyQUOTATION_MARK. What is your favorite movie? <|endoftext|> my favorite is dirty dancing. I am looking for recommendations on movies I can buy for my husband for as a christmas gift. what would you recommend? <|endoftext|> For recent movies, I really like QUOTATION_MARKSullyQUOTATION_MARK, the true story about when a pilot landed a plane on The Hudson River in New York in 2009, in freezing conditions. The 2 minute trailer for it on YouTube is also very exciting. <|endoftext|> I have not seen that one. I will have to check it out. thank you. have you seen the movie what dreams may come? my son and I were actually talking about it yesterday. its a movie from 1998 but the graphics are very vibrant and rich. The concept of the movie is very unique which is something that I enjoy. I get tired of watching movies that have the same concepts but with different actors. <|endoftext|> I've heard of that movie, with Robin Williams. I have it on my list of movies I want to see. Your husband will enjoy QUOTATION_MARKSullyQUOTATION_MARK. It's a movie you can watch parts of over and over, because of the tension and drama of landing the plane. <|endoftext|> I will check out the trailer for the movie. Do you have any other recommendations? I worry about the movie being about landing a plane only because my husband was in the military and has some ptsd so I have to be careful with what we watch. He doesn't do well with military, helicopters, war or planes. <|endoftext|> Maybe a non-action drama would be better. I highly recommend QUOTATION_MARKSpotlightQUOTATION_MARK about The Boston Globe and their investigative efforts. No action, just people working hard. <|endoftext|> Thank you I am sure that we both would enjoy that movie. Thank you for your help I feel good about that movie it sounds very interesting and something the whole family can enjoy. <|endoftext|> I have selected QUOTATION_MARKSpotlightQUOTATION_MARK on the left. It shows some details about it. <|endoftext|> I will definitely check it out. thank you for your help. is there any other movie you would suggest <|endoftext|> Another investigative movie is 'TruthQUOTATION_MARK about CBS News. <|endoftext|> he does enjoy his news. can you go into more detail about the plot of the movie <|endoftext|> It's about when Dan Rather was the evening news anchor, and they were investigating George Bush (Jr.), and they believed a man who gave them information, but who wasn't totally trustworthy. <|endoftext|> what year was the movie made? <|endoftext|> It was released in 2015. <|endoftext|> oh wow Im surprised that we havent watched it yet. because hes really big on politics and news. this sounds like another great option. <|endoftext|> There's also QUOTATION_MARKThe Post' from 2017, about The Washington PostQUOTATION_MARK with Tom Hanks. <|endoftext|> we have seen that one it was a good movie. I will check out the 2 you recommended. <|endoftext|> It was good chatting with you. Have a great day. <|endoftext|> thank you. I enjoyed the chat as well enjoy the rest of your day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there. So, please tell me what kind of genre of movies you are into? <|endoftext|> I love comedy and drama! <|endoftext|> Do you like Adam Sandler movies? <|endoftext|> I do, are there any new ones? <|endoftext|> Have you heard of the new Adam Sandler movie called Uncut Gems? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't <|endoftext|> Uncut Gems stars Adam Sandler. It's about the stock market and the journey of a wall street start up beginner, who tries to make a name of himself. It's crime and suspense with wide notes of comical energy. It's based on a true store. <|endoftext|> Oh, wow,that sounds like a good movie, so Adam plays a more serious type of role? <|endoftext|> Yes, he does. I think it's pretty interesting considering he is known for his comedic side. <|endoftext|> That would be an interesting movie to see, I wonder if he is good at being in a serious part. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> I have not seen it yet. But I am highly interested in seeing it, based on Sandler is one of my favortie comedians. Would you be interested in seeing it? <|endoftext|> I would have to see a trailer before going to a theater, is it brand new or on a streaming service? I think he is very talented in comedy too. <|endoftext|> The movie comes out December 25th of this year in theaters across the united states. I saw the trailer on Youtube. It looked really good! <|endoftext|> Oh, Ok! So I can watch a trailer first and then wait for it to come out. I have enjoyed all of his movies and think I would seriously think about this one as well. Still a bit unsure do you know who else stars in the film?, <|endoftext|> Kevin Garnett, Idina Menzel, and some other newer actors and actresses. You should definitely check out the trailer. <|endoftext|> I will check out the trailer. Did you see him in the movie with Jennifer Aniston? I think it was called Murder Mystery. Do you think it will be as good as that? <|endoftext|> I have seen Murder Mystery, yes. I thought that Aniston and Sandler did an amazing job together in that one! <|endoftext|> I did too! I love them both! <|endoftext|> Yes, I totally agree! <|endoftext|> Well thank you so much for your recommendation! I am definitely going to watch the trailer and most likely see the film! Thank you so much, it sounds like a really great movie. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you? Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Avengers: Endgame <|endoftext|> What is that about? <|endoftext|> It's a Marvel movie where a bunch of superheros have to figure out how to beat Thanos <|endoftext|> Do you like superhero movies in particular? <|endoftext|> i love them. do you have a movie recommendation for me that's superhero related? <|endoftext|> I do have a recommendation of the movie Joker <|endoftext|> do you know where I can find the movie trailer for that? <|endoftext|> I can find it for you. Let me tell you a little more about it. <|endoftext|> That'll be great. Also a link to the movie trailer would be fantastic, too <|endoftext|> Sure, a comedian named Arthur Fleck slowly begins a downward spiral as he is bullied in society. <|endoftext|> sounds great. i'll check out Joker. thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> Yes, it's still playing in theaters. <|endoftext|> is joker the superhero of the movie? <|endoftext|> He is a villain, but it shows his downward spiral to become the character who opposes Batman <|endoftext|> are there any superheros in this movie? that's what I'm interested in <|endoftext|> Well, although Batman isn't directly in it Bruce Wayne's parents are in it and you'll surely get a great glimpse into why he becomes villainous toward the superhero! <|endoftext|> sounds interesting. did it come out recently? <|endoftext|> yes, it just came out in October 2019. Will you accept my recommendation? <|endoftext|> I do. I want to watch it. thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> i like movies that are different <|endoftext|> Hi, I'm looking for a good movie recommendation to watch with my sister and brother in law over the holidays <|endoftext|> Then go with Scrooged with Bill Murray, cant go wrong <|endoftext|> Yes. That's a classic. But we've seen it already and would like something more recent <|endoftext|> I think Ive got just the thing, im looking <|endoftext|> It doesn't have to be christmas related. We like a lot of different things. Foreign movies and suspense are our favorite genres but we also like comedies, particularly if they're dark <|endoftext|> Try happy chirstmas with melanie lynskie <|endoftext|> Haven't heard about it. What is it about? <|endoftext|> A sister comes home to stay with her brother and wife and life gets what lifes about, cool drama <|endoftext|> Awesome! It sounds great. I love the actresses. I accept you recommendation :-) <|endoftext|> well sounds like i need more clicks <|endoftext|> I guess so. haha.

Also, I love action with some butt kicking and martial arts scenes. <|endoftext|> Kids and I have watched a few movies this week. What was the last movie you saw? What was good/bad about it? <|endoftext|> The last one I saw was the latest Purge movie and I really enjoyed that. The good was though theme was the same, there were some resistance beginning to be considered. The bad was the purge violence appeared a bit forced, but I liked it. <|endoftext|> I saw that too! The purge are pretty good movies. Last one I saw wat It2! It was pretty good and we liked it. You have to watch the first one first to get connected to the story. <|endoftext|> I saw the first one and loved it. What was also good about the second one was that they brought back a couple of the Purge 1 cast; that was cool. I'm looking forward to a movie coming out during Christmas; saw a preview of it; but did'nt catch the name. I'll be looking for that one!!! <|endoftext|> Didnt catch the name? Who was in it? What was it about? <|endoftext|> I remember; it is Black Christmas and it's about a college campus where they're preparing for the holiday when the murders begin. Looks like my kind of movie. <|endoftext|> I recommend seeing it! <|endoftext|> Black Christmas it is and I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> I watched the trailer. Looks pretty good. Some people might call the name of the movie racist. <|endoftext|> I don't see it that way. Some people are too sensitive. I'm not and I don't see it that way at all! <|endoftext|> I agree! I dont recognize any stars in the trailer. <|endoftext|> No, neither did I, but you know they bring in newbies when making a movie like this; remember Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween. She did great! <|endoftext|> Yeah! That was a long time ago! Makes me feel old! <|endoftext|> I know. Don't feel old because I am really old and still love watching all of the Halloweens on Halloween and all of the Friday the 13th's on Friday the 13th. Hilarious! <|endoftext|> I agree! <|endoftext|> You're only as old as you feel. I'm still a kid at heart! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, what genre of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> Hi, nice to meet you <|endoftext|> nice to meet you too! <|endoftext|> I love dramas <|endoftext|> What is a good drama movie you have watched reccently? <|endoftext|> Let me think on that a minute <|endoftext|> Ok, no problem! <|endoftext|> My mind is a blank right now. But I love good acting, that's very important <|endoftext|> A good drama you may be interested in is Taxi Driver, the film tells the story of a lonely taxi driver, who descends into insanity <|endoftext|> Is that the one with Robert Deniro? <|endoftext|> Yes it is!- <|endoftext|> Yes, I've seen that one. It's very good. I think he won an award for that one. Do you have any newer recommendations? <|endoftext|> A movie with a similar concept is The Joker 2019 <|endoftext|> Oh yea, I've been wanting to see that one. Do you know is it still at the theater? <|endoftext|> Not sure, but it was really good. <|endoftext|> You saw it? <|endoftext|> Yes I did see it. <|endoftext|> Ok, I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> Thanks for your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> im good how are you? <|endoftext|> im doing good. do you want to talk about movies with me? <|endoftext|> sure. what kind of movies do you like? My favorite are horror movies or movies about animals <|endoftext|> i like movies about action and horror flicks. <|endoftext|> Do you have any good horror films you could recommend? <|endoftext|> sure, how about annabelle <|endoftext|> I thought that was a good movie <|endoftext|> definitely and scary too. Do you want me to send a recommendation for that movie? <|endoftext|> Yes please <|endoftext|> ok sure thing. what other movies do you like with animals? <|endoftext|> I like snow dogs and the incredible journey and old yeller. It's a long list lol <|endoftext|> lol i like homeward bound also. one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> I also loved where the red fern grows <|endoftext|> yeah. do you prefer annabelle or homeward bound for recommendation? <|endoftext|> Lets go with homeward bound <|endoftext|> sounds good. I will recommend that movie. <|endoftext|> okay thank you <|endoftext|> ok sent. your very welcome. <|endoftext|> Have a good day! <|endoftext|> you too. have a nice one. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello I am here to help you find a movie. <|endoftext|> Thanks. I really like comedy movies. <|endoftext|> What was the latest comedy movie that you have watched? <|endoftext|> I like comedy movies I can watch with my family. For instance, Toy Story 4. <|endoftext|> That is a great movie! <|endoftext|> Yeah, I liked the new Frozen movie but it was a bit dark for me though it did have elements of comedy. <|endoftext|> So do you prefer animation? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I do prefer it though non animated family comedy films are good too. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Addams Family yet? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. I thought about seeing it but didn't get around to it. I liked the Adams Family from the 90s when I was a kid. <|endoftext|> yes me too! <|endoftext|> I think it's fun when movies have celebrity voices too so you can recognize them. However that is not necessary for me to enjoy a movie. <|endoftext|> I think you and the kiddos would enjoy this movie and have lots of laughs. <|endoftext|> Have you seen it yourself? Did you like it? <|endoftext|> Yes and it was so cute and funny. <|endoftext|> So would kids and adults both enjoy it? <|endoftext|> Yes it has adult humor as well as kids humor as well. I remember the old movies and it throws you back. You will love that part. <|endoftext|> Great, I'm excited to watch it. <|endoftext|> at's awesomyou and I hope you and the family really enjoy the movie :) <|endoftext|> Are there action parts too? <|endoftext|> Oh yeah plenty of action you will not get bored I promise <|endoftext|> Great, thank you, it sounds fun with bits of nostalgia, comedy, and action. My kind of thing. I would like to watch the movie you recommended. <|endoftext|> You're welcome it was my pleasure assisting you :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, are you a big movie fan too? I really like movies <|endoftext|> Yes I enjoy watching movies especially comediesand animation. <|endoftext|> Animation and comedies are great, and nice for get-togethers. I saw Avengers: Endgame recently and really liked it and the CGI. It was dramatic and had a good payoff for their long-running story, esp Ironman. What about you? <|endoftext|> I am looking for a good movieto make me smile. Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> If you like comedies and animation then the Star Wars movie coming up with baby Yoda would be really nice. He's wonderful and amazing. <|endoftext|> I never got into the Star Wars series. Any others? <|endoftext|> You might enjoy Addams Family. Its always pretty funny. In another genre, the sequel to the Shining is coming out, its Doctor Sleep and its supposed to be good so I would recommend it. <|endoftext|> Isn't the Shining a horror movie? I definitely do not do horror. I am a big baby! <|endoftext|> Oh okay. Well you might like to check into Charlies Angels, it looks fun and its a comedy and light-hearted enough for the holidays. Hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> That may be up my alley. I do like a good chick flick. <|endoftext|> In terms of animation, there's a fantasy film that's out called White Snake, thats looking like a solid one.. <|endoftext|> Hmmm I haven't heard of that. Do you know what it is about?Or maybe a holiday movie? <|endoftext|> There's a holiday time movie that's animated, something like this? <|endoftext|> Is that the name of it? Holiday Time? <|endoftext|> First off there's Frozen II. Its an animated sequel to Disney's Frozen movie, really popular. <|endoftext|> Yes I would love to see that. Great Idea! I accept that recommendation! Thank you! <|endoftext|> Thanks! Enjoy your movie! <|endoftext|> Thank you so much! <|endoftext|> Of course. I really think you'll like it, and you might catch QUOTATION_MARKThe StarQUOTATION_MARK, that was the other animated holiday film I was thinking of. Take care! <|endoftext|> Happy Holidays! <|endoftext|> Frozen II <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you! <|endoftext|> I'm great! Thank you! I'm looking for a new movie recommendation in horror. <|endoftext|> Oh great! What is the last horror movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last one I watched was It Chapter Two. I liked it. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Annabelle 2? <|endoftext|> I saw the first one and didn't think it was all that good. So I didn't see the second one. <|endoftext|> Gotcha! I actually totally agree with you on that statement. <|endoftext|> I do know of a movie that I want to see because I think it will be good. It's called Doctor Sleep. <|endoftext|> I was just going to recommend that movie! Stephen King is amazing! <|endoftext|> It was the movie adaptation of The Shining that I liked, when Danny Torrence was a boy. Seen it several times. <|endoftext|> Yes! That was a classic! Would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> The trailer for Doctor Sleep? <|endoftext|> Yep! The trailer will make you want to see it even more, its great. <|endoftext|> Maybe. I'm afraid it will scare me, however. <|endoftext|> Personally I don't think it captured any moments that were traumatizing to the eye. I would totally recommend it since you are interested in horror movies. <|endoftext|> Are you sure I won't get scared? <|endoftext|> yes I think you will be fine! <|endoftext|> Okay. I suppose I could watch the trailer. You are reassuring. <|endoftext|> Awesome! you will love it <|endoftext|> Cool! I accept! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> HI <|endoftext|> What movie genres are you currently interested in? <|endoftext|> I like Sci-fi and comedy movies <|endoftext|> Sounds good I like the same movies. If your interested in comedies theres a new movie called knifed out that is critically acclaimed <|endoftext|> I saw a trailer for it, i think. What's it about? It has some big stars, doesn't it? <|endoftext|> Yea the film has big stars in it. Basically the film is a mix of murder mystery, crime, thriller, with heavy aspects of comedy. Overall the comedy offsets the cime aspect of the film making it a fun watch. Overall the film is about a family where a murder takes place and the cast tries to solve who was murdered. Without spoilers thats how much I can really go into. <|endoftext|> Sounds good...KNives Out, though, not Knifed. I think my wife wanted to see it. <|endoftext|> Correct, I apologize for the misspelling. Would this be a film you would interested in seeing in the near future? <|endoftext|> Yeah--I remember now--it has Captain AMerica in it. I like this recommendation. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Would you be interested in seeing any new sci fi movies as well? <|endoftext|> SUre, I know Star Wars is coming out, and that's a must see. ANyhting else Ii'm missing? <|endoftext|> Star Wars is a good one. Have you seen Ad Astra recently. The film released in the past not recently but it still relatively new and a great sci fi movie <|endoftext|> Nope, I missed that one. I am hoping they make another star trek movie. <|endoftext|> Yea they usually have good films for the series. <|endoftext|> Hey--I will check out Ad Astra, and definitely the Knives Out. Thanks for you assistance! <|endoftext|> Sounds good I was happy to help you decide what films to watch next <|endoftext|> One more question--do you have any idea about the upcoming Marvel movies? I think there's one with Black Widow. <|endoftext|> Yes the new marvel film is a standalone black widow movie. I believe the film is set to release early 2020. I reccomend this film also, based on the success of the last marvel movies <|endoftext|> Excellent--and I like Scarlett Johanssen <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> hi i would like to see something funny about  pirates and johnny depp. <|endoftext|> do you like vintage movies> <|endoftext|> sometimes but not always,how about something with john candy? <|endoftext|> did you see uncle buck <|endoftext|> I have never seen that one and i have heard it is very funny. <|endoftext|> you should see it.. its hillarious <|endoftext|> Who else is in it? <|endoftext|> Amy Madigan,Jean Louisa Kelly, Gaby Hoffmann  and few others.. its a classic comedy <|endoftext|> Those are very funny people  i shall take your recommendation <|endoftext|> how about home alone? its even better <|endoftext|> Yes that is a good one what was that boys name again? <|endoftext|> Macaulay Culkin <|endoftext|> yes that is him very funny. I will take my selections and watch with my kids tonight. thank you very much, <|endoftext|> good choice <|endoftext|> both are excellent recommendations good bye. <|endoftext|> great thanks <|endoftext|> john candy is one if the greatest if all time <|endoftext|> comedy stars always rocks <|endoftext|> he always is funny  with chevy chase and dan aykroyd <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there. I hear you're looking for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Yes, I always look for new movies to watch <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> Adventure <|endoftext|> Have you seen the remade Jumanji films? <|endoftext|> No. Have you? <|endoftext|> Yes. I've seen the first one and am definitely checking out the sequel when it comes out. <|endoftext|> Ok, thanks.

If you saw it as a kid, like I did, the new one is a great mix of the action from that one with a little more adult humor. They aged the series really well. <|endoftext|> Sometimes old adventure movies are more fun to watch. Netflix just added The Time Machine, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm definitely gonna watch it again. <|endoftext|> Nice. I always forget to check when new movies are added to Netflix. <|endoftext|> I think they could add much more.. sometimes there\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds only few new movies available. I would like to see much more for sure. I think they could also add more documentaries about science and travel <|endoftext|> If you're familiar with Reddit, there's a page on there just about new documentaries and they'll mention where the movies can be streamed. <|endoftext|> Sure, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll check it out. I usually just search the internet for what\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds new. They add new movies on the first of the month I think <|endoftext|> So (insert super-cool segue here) how are you feeling about watching the Jumanji trailer? <|endoftext|> I had a lot of fun watching it. Love the actors <|endoftext|> I'm glad you enjoyed it. <|endoftext|> I think next year will be exciting for new movies. I heard Avatar 2 is coming next year <|endoftext|> You know, I didn't actually see the first one. I think I prefer reading sci-fi to watching it. Except for Star Trek. Speaking of sci-fi, did you happen to see Zathura? It was written by the same author as Jumanji and is technically in the same cinematic universe. <|endoftext|> Yes, I watched Zathura. It was a great movie <|endoftext|> So I think I've got you set with Jumanji. If you like the first one, you've got another you can watch in a couple weeks. Looking for anything else? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. I was wondering what movies do you like. <|endoftext|> I love to watch comedy movies can you help me out with a great suggestion? <|endoftext|> Yes of course. I have a good movie for you. Its called Booksmart. <|endoftext|> Whats that movie about? <|endoftext|> Its about a couple of best friends missing out time from their teenage years and they decide to make up for lost time into one night. <|endoftext|> Sounds like a good movie, who are the leading actors of the movie? <|endoftext|> Katalyn Dever and Beanie Feldstein. <|endoftext|> Haven't heard of them before, when did the movie come out? <|endoftext|> It was released on May 24 of this year. <|endoftext|> Oh so its a recent movie I love comedy movies so I think I will watch that trailer, seems worth my while. <|endoftext|> I think you will love it. <|endoftext|> Ok great thanks for the suggestion then. <|endoftext|> Of course. I do have another comedy movie. Are you a fan of Emma Thompson? <|endoftext|> Yeah I think she is a great actress, please tell me about that movie. <|endoftext|> Sure. The movie that I'm recommending for you is Late Night. <|endoftext|> Who else is in the movie? <|endoftext|> Mindy Kaling, Max Cassela, and John Lithgow. <|endoftext|> I recognize some of those names, I think I will watch that one first. <|endoftext|> That is fine. Its a really funny movie!!! <|endoftext|> I bet it is! thanks a lot for the suggestion I'm sure I will love watching the Late Night trailer. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I would like to help you find a film that you would enjoy. <|endoftext|> That would be great. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you usually enjoy? <|endoftext|> I like anything that has a good storyline. I watch all types of movies. I am thinking a good comdey. <|endoftext|> Are there any actors you usually enjoy in a comedy? <|endoftext|> I do like Kevin Hart or Will Farrow. <|endoftext|> The Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle remake has Kevin Hart in it and is a lot of fun. It's a great comedy that you can watch with the whole family. <|endoftext|> Has that one came out yet. I didn't think it was out. <|endoftext|> It came out in 2017. It also stars the Rock. <|endoftext|> Oh ok yeah I saw that one. I did see there was a new one coming out. Do you have anything else in mind? <|endoftext|> Night School is another good one with Kevin Hart if you want a comedy for a date night. <|endoftext|> I forgot about that one. I do like that recommendation accept that one. <|endoftext|> Great! I am glad I could help you. <|endoftext|> Thanks so much would be watching that tonight. Is it kid friendly or adults only? <|endoftext|> It's rated PG-13 so probably best for adults only or with teens. <|endoftext|> Oh in that case as a back up for the kids.Do you have another you would recommend? <|endoftext|> Since it's the holidays and you like Will Ferrell, Elf is a great comedy to watch with the kids. <|endoftext|> Yeah that one would be perfect. <|endoftext|> Wonderful! Have a great day. <|endoftext|> You have one as well thanks for the recommedation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today. <|endoftext|> Fine and you <|endoftext|> I am good! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> Yes of course, I love action movies a lot <|endoftext|> What was the last action movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Gemini Man? <|endoftext|> I have! I enjoy the work of the director, Ang Lee, a lot. <|endoftext|> Yeah it is a great movie and some other got high recommendations too <|endoftext|> Yes it is! Another good action movie that I enjoyed greatly was Mission Impossible: Fallout. Have you seen this movie yet? <|endoftext|> You can bet your money on that I have seen it, have you seen shaw and hobbs? <|endoftext|> Yes I have! It was a very fun experience to watch that movie in the theater. It reminded me of my experience watching John Wick 3. <|endoftext|> Oh, that is the greatest of all lately, I enjoy watching it over again. <|endoftext|> Are you looking for a movie that has a similar story to any of these films we've talked about? <|endoftext|> I won't mind if I get one or two from you <|endoftext|> If you enjoyed John Wick, I would recommend a movie called The Raid 2. It's a foreign film with a very similar storyline to John Wick and has earned many accolades. <|endoftext|> That is great, I will add that to my cart now and see that movie soonest <|endoftext|> I think you will enjoy it. It has nonstop action just like it's predecessor. However, it's not necessary to watch the first film in order to understand the second, much like John Wick. <|endoftext|> Ok, I will do some findings on that, thanks for the recommendation. I accept the recommendation <|endoftext|> So, would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I will <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hai <|endoftext|> hii <|endoftext|> tele me sir <|endoftext|> which movie is better for watching <|endoftext|> 1917 war <|endoftext|> oh i like it <|endoftext|> same to you <|endoftext|> but this movie is old <|endoftext|> i am not see new film <|endoftext|> yup but tell me some new movie <|endoftext|> good morning <|endoftext|> good morning <|endoftext|> how are you? <|endoftext|> fine you tell <|endoftext|> what do you want ? <|endoftext|> i want some entertainment movies name <|endoftext|> crawl film <|endoftext|> i don't like these type of film <|endoftext|> sorry boorksmart movie <|endoftext|> ok mension not <|endoftext|> i like it movie <|endoftext|> oh good but tell me some adventure movies <|endoftext|> hostile takedown <|endoftext|> ohhh i like it <|endoftext|> ok any question ? <|endoftext|> no but tell some more movies <|endoftext|> jumanji movie <|endoftext|> i like it but i will watch later <|endoftext|> i late watch movie <|endoftext|> would you recomended me this movie <|endoftext|> i dont know other movies <|endoftext|> okay <|endoftext|> ok bye have a nice day <|endoftext|> same to you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello Hope all is well tonight <|endoftext|> everything is fine <|endoftext|> Great!

What is the latest movie you have watched? What did you like about the movie most and what did you dislike? <|endoftext|> I loved QUOTATION_MARKovercomerQUOTATION_MARK the plot was wonderful. I really was moved whem the dad recorded messages for his daughter. <|endoftext|> I really would like to see that movie. The last movie I seen was Toy Story 4. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one. I am not a fan of animated movies. <|endoftext|> Not much here either my kids wanted to go see. <|endoftext|> Do you have any movie to reccommend that are uplifting, with a spiritual content? <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Case for Christ? <|endoftext|> I have not. What is it about? I enjoy movies, but I dislkie documentaries. <|endoftext|> You may not like that one then. What about BREAKTHROUGH? BREAKTHROUGH is based on the inspirational true story of one mother's unfaltering love in the face of impossible odds. <|endoftext|> I have heard of that. I do appreciate and will accept your reccomendation. Thank you. <|endoftext|> Thank You. Have a great evening. <|endoftext|> I hope you also have a great evening. <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy seeing the movie when you get a chance. <|endoftext|> Did you enjoy it when you watched it? <|endoftext|> Yes it was a great movie. <|endoftext|> I plan to see it very soon <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I am doing pretty good. Hows your weekend? <|endoftext|> It's been great. I live in Florida so the weather has been wonderful. I did stay in though last night and rewatched Elf, though. It's a classic! <|endoftext|> I was in Destin last weekend. It was nice. I have heard about the Elf movie, however I didn't get a chance to watch so far. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> I watched Lion King today. I watched earlier. Again I watched with my 4 year old daughter today. <|endoftext|> Is it the newest release? or the animated version from 1994? <|endoftext|> Its the latest release. <|endoftext|> Oh, what did you think of it overall? I saw it in theaters this summer. <|endoftext|> The animation is really awesome. I enjoyed very much. What type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like all movies! My taste ranges from indie drama films all the way to movies appropriate for children such as yours. <|endoftext|> Your taste is somewhat similar like me. However Action & Thriller movies are my favorite. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen any of the John Wick movies? <|endoftext|> I watched the 1 & 2. I have to watch the 3rd. <|endoftext|> What did you like about the movies, or anything you didn't like? Sometimes action movies get monotonous with the plot. Are you wanting to watch the 3rd or do you feel more apathetic about it? <|endoftext|> I will watch the 3 for sure. I like the movies with nice screenplay. I don't like the movies with the expected ending or boring screenplay. <|endoftext|> Are you a Tom Hardy fan? <|endoftext|> I am a big fan. Who is your favorite? <|endoftext|> Tom Hardy, Ryan Gosling, and Jake Gyllenhall in more independent films,actually. He has some films not many people are familiar with. Have you heard of the movie Drive or Nightcrawler? <|endoftext|> I haven't watched both of them. I have heard about Nightcrawler. I will try to watch. <|endoftext|> Tom Hardy is great and has some amazing action/thriller films he is in as well. <|endoftext|> He is great. His voice is more unique. <|endoftext|> He starred in Locke, and the film is just him in a car the entire time; it's actually brilliant. <|endoftext|> Really I am going to watch tonight. <|endoftext|> Wonderful!

Would you recommend it? <|endoftext|> YES!! It is a great drama starring Brad Pitt. <|endoftext|> I notice that it also includes Anthony Hopkins like Silence of the Lambs.

I'd like to help you look for a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Hi, I am interested in a mystery or thriller. <|endoftext|> Awesome, there are a lot of great thrillers. Whats the best thriller that you have seen this year? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen any good thrillers lately but I liked Seven when it came out. <|endoftext|> Yeah that's definitely a good one. What did you like about it? <|endoftext|> It felt like I was also a detective trying to solve the murders. <|endoftext|> Yes I see, I think I have an idea of what to recommend to you. <|endoftext|> Great, thanks. Are there any big actors in it? <|endoftext|> Yes, do you like Robert Downey Jr? <|endoftext|> Yeah, he's cool. <|endoftext|> Okay, I recommend the movie Zodiac, its about the zodiac killer frenzy in the 70s, and its also a mystery/thriller. <|endoftext|> I just saw a documentary on the Zodiac killer so that might be a really good choice. <|endoftext|> Oh really? If you found the documentary interesting, then I would definitely watch the movie! <|endoftext|> Is that the one with Jake Gyllenhal in it? <|endoftext|> Yes Jake Gyllenhal is in it! <|endoftext|> Awesome, I think I would like to see that one. <|endoftext|> Okay perfect, glad you accept my recommendation! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> No problem! <|endoftext|> Wait. Are there any other movies that are like this? <|endoftext|> Yes, theres a lot good of mystery/thriller movies about serial killers.

How about Split? <|endoftext|> no, that movie was boring. i have seen that before with the guy with different personalities. <|endoftext|> Alright how about Addicted? <|endoftext|> i have never seen addicted before. is it good? <|endoftext|> Yes, give it a try. <|endoftext|> ok. send me the trailer for addicted. i would accept it. <|endoftext|> Just google you will find it on youtube. <|endoftext|> ok. i can do that. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi! <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> how are you? <|endoftext|> Good! I'm looking for a movie to watch, can you recommend a trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes! Are you looking for a movie in theaters or one you can watch online? <|endoftext|> In theaters sounds good! <|endoftext|> Great! I recently saw the film Jojo Rabbit, which is basically a satire of WWII. Long story short, they could have made the film insensitive in so many ways, but it was actually really good <|endoftext|> Ooh, I haven't heard of that! I like satire, that sounds like a good one. <|endoftext|> Yes, I highly recommend it. It has just the right amount of humor. Rebel Wilson is even in it! <|endoftext|> No way! I just watched the trailer. I accept this recommendation. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Jojo Rabbit <|endoftext|> Gotta love Scarlett Johansson, too <|endoftext|> Definitely! So would you see this movie? <|endoftext|> I would! It sounds very unlike other movies I have seen. <|endoftext|> Yay! It's so well done <|endoftext|> How is the soundtrack? <|endoftext|> Good! I think they remade some Beatles songs in German actually for it <|endoftext|> Oh really? That's neat <|endoftext|> Yes! Such a unique film <|endoftext|> Just noticed Theon Greyjoy is in it too, no way <|endoftext|> Yes! I hope you enjoy the film :) <|endoftext|> Thanks! I appreciate the recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> hey, what's up? <|endoftext|> what types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i like psychological thrillers the most <|endoftext|> what movie did you see last? <|endoftext|> The Silence of the Lambs <|endoftext|> Since you say you like thriller movies, what about a trailer for the Joker? <|endoftext|> sure, i've been interested in that movie anyway. i don't think i've seen the trailer. <|endoftext|> okay, got it <|endoftext|> should i watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> yes <|endoftext|> looks good so far <|endoftext|> okay great <|endoftext|> i think i'll go see this movie. i wonder how long it'll still be in theaters for <|endoftext|> probably at least another month <|endoftext|> have you seen it? <|endoftext|> not yet <|endoftext|> i heard it's a lot like Taxi Driver, which i love <|endoftext|> I have not heard of that <|endoftext|> it's pretty old. De Niro's in it. anyway, i accept the reccomendation of Joker. thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you find a movie trailer you will like. Do you know what kind of movie trailer you are interested in watching? <|endoftext|> I think I'd like a comedy. <|endoftext|> OK! There are a lot of great comedy trailers out right now. Do you have any particular actors/actresses you want to see, or do you want to be surprised? <|endoftext|> I want to be surprised! <|endoftext|> Let me ask just a few more questions to help find something unique you will enjoy. What are some of your favorite comedies? <|endoftext|> I like Monty Python and the Holy Grail a lot. <|endoftext|> That's definitely a classic, and one of my personal favorites as well. Sounds like you appreciate movies that are witty as well as goofy. <|endoftext|> Yes, I think that's a good assessment of my taste! <|endoftext|> I think British humor is often distinctly unique when compared to the popular sensibilities of other regions. Would you prefer to watch another British film, or do you have no preference for where the movie was made? <|endoftext|> I have no preference really. <|endoftext|> Alright. Let me pull up some recommendations for you. <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> As I give you recommendations, please feel free to give me feedback on how you feel about my suggestions! If you don't like the sound of a movie, or find the description incredibly appealing, let me know - it will help me calibrate to your tastes and hopefully find you some great trailers you will like! <|endoftext|> Thank you so much for your help! <|endoftext|> OK - my first recommendation is Being John Malkovich. It's set in current day, and definitely incorporates a surreal element. The premise is that John Cusack finds a portal that leads him into the mind of movie star John Malkovich - who plays a dramatized version of himself. He does a great job and seems to have a lot of fun with the role. It was nominated for three Oscars. <|endoftext|> That sounds really interesting, I like the surreal elements. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I think so! <|endoftext|> Wonderful. I really hope you enjoy it! (I'm probably going to watch it again tonight, I haven't seen it in a while and bringing it up reminded me how much I liked it!) <|endoftext|> Thank you for the recommendation! I am really looking forward to watching, and appreciate your awesome recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Awesome! I was wanting to go out and watch a movie! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I want to be able to go out with a group of friends, so maybe a comedy or an action movie. <|endoftext|> would you like to see  QUOTATION_MARKA Rainy Day in New YorkQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I don't think it's a good fit, no. A little less rom-com. Maybe something a bit more like the movie QUOTATION_MARKTagQUOTATION_MARK in which it's mostly comedy with a bit of action peppered in? <|endoftext|> Alright, wil you like to see 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' <|endoftext|> What is that about? <|endoftext|> this is best movie when you are in desperate need of a good belly laugh. <|endoftext|> Well... That sounds like it could be a winner then. I think that'll be the movie I go see then! Thank you!! <|endoftext|> Got it <|endoftext|> Though, I do have a couple more questions about the movie, if you don't mind. Is the movie plot heavy or is it mostly just for laughs? <|endoftext|> you will see your favorite Jay Baruchel and F. Murray Abraham. You know what they stands for. <|endoftext|> Those are the actors, yes. Is the movie any good? <|endoftext|> Yes, a mix of adventure, comedy and fantasy <|endoftext|> Is there any movies I should watch before I watch this movie? <|endoftext|> Not really, you watch this right away <|endoftext|> So this is a standalone. It's not the second or third of a series of movies? <|endoftext|> Well, its the first in the series and I'm sure you and your friends would like it <|endoftext|> Okay, think that's it then! Sounds like a winner to me! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> what type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i like action and horror as my favorites. <|endoftext|> have you seen <|endoftext|> Last movie I seen was Halloween and John Wick. <|endoftext|> both good movies, I like the john wick movies <|endoftext|> me 2. one of Keenau Reeves favorites. <|endoftext|> Yes! Have you seen ford v ferrari? <|endoftext|> as a matter of fact im going to see that tonight in theaters. <|endoftext|> awesome, would you want to see trailer first? <|endoftext|> I have seen the trailer, I enjoyed it. <|endoftext|> how about the irishman? <|endoftext|> i never seen that, what is it about? <|endoftext|> In the 1950s, truck driver Frank Sheeran gets involved with Russell Bufalino and his Pennsylvania crime family. <|endoftext|> that would be something I like to watch. <|endoftext|> You should watch the trailer, movie got great reviews <|endoftext|> ok i would be willing to try it. <|endoftext|> enjoy nice chatting <|endoftext|> you too. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, so I hear your interested in movies <|endoftext|> Yes, I am interested in movies. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Action, Sci-Fi, Abstract, all kinds of different movies. Even some kids movies! Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yes, do you think you would like the irishman? <|endoftext|> What is that about? <|endoftext|> Its about the mafias involvement with the teamsters labor movement and politicians in Washington <|endoftext|> Yes, that sounds like a movie I can get into. Do you have any others? <|endoftext|> Hobbs & Shaw which is an action movie <|endoftext|> The reason I asked is because I like to have options and choose from my options. I actually have heard good things about Hobbs & Shaw. I accept Hobbs & Shaw.. <|endoftext|> Do you think you would like Fast & Furious 6, just like Hobbs and Shaw. <|endoftext|> I'm sure I would. I'll have to check them both out and even the whole franchise. I would like something out of the box though. Do you have any good abstract, QUOTATION_MARKwhoaQUOTATION_MARK movies, such as Intersteller? <|endoftext|> indeed I do, would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would like to see the trailer. <|endoftext|> great I have selected it so you should get it <|endoftext|> That's great. I am excited to check it out. I appreciate it. <|endoftext|> Awesome, I too enjoy these at my old age. Its my pleasure to help! <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy recommending movies to more people! <|endoftext|> So far this has been fun! Yes I will enjoy performing this task. <|endoftext|> I accept your movie recommendations and will check them all out soon! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you chose a movie <|endoftext|> Great! I'm excited to hear what you may have picked out! <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you normally like to watch? <|endoftext|> I love comedies and documentaries, personally. Comedies especially. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? And do you normally watch movies online with something like Netflix/Hulu or do you prefer to watch in the movie theater? <|endoftext|> I like watching both in theater and at home, but Netflix is usually where I watch movies. I recently had my friends watch This Is The End, since they hadn't seen it. I love that movie. <|endoftext|> Do you want to watch something similar to that or something new? <|endoftext|> Something similar, at least in the vein of being funny, but also ridiculous. I'm a fan of dumb comedies, to be honest. The dumber the better. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the Austin Powers movies? <|endoftext|> I've seen the first two, and part of the third, which I thought sucked, sadly. The first one is a classic. <|endoftext|> What about Johnny English? Its been a couple of years since I've watched it but I remember it being similar to Austin Powers in the line of dumb spy comedy. <|endoftext|> I've never heard of it, but it sounds intriguing. Tell me more :) <|endoftext|> It's got the guy from Mr. Bean in it. Basically he's a mess of an agent because the directors of the agency never really intended for him to become an agent. <|endoftext|> I love Rowan Atkinson! I love Mr. Bean! I am definitely interested in this now. I love his chaotic but innocent energy. <|endoftext|> Good! I didn't realize it wouldn't let me send more than one message at a time and I was going to send you a trailer. Mr. Bean is the total embodiment of chaotic energy. <|endoftext|> Awesome. Thank you so much! This definitely looks right up my alley. Do you know if it's available for streaming? <|endoftext|> It was on netflix a little while ago but I think it might have been taken off. If it is gone its probably on Youtube. <|endoftext|> Okay, thanks. I'll be on the look-out for it. If not, I can always IMDB Rowan Atkinson, lol. <|endoftext|> That works too haha <|endoftext|> Thanks so much for helping me out today. Hope you have a good day, and I'm going to see about enjoying this movie. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good morning! <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> So what sort of movies are you into? What sort of trailers do you like? <|endoftext|> Well, since it is the holiday season I love watching Christmas movies. I know the ones on Netflix are not considered good movies but they are fun and I enjoy laughing at and with them. <|endoftext|> Hm, there's a few new ones for this year that look like they might be funny. Netflix movies are perfectly acceptable! There's a new Disney one called Noelle that looks funny! <|endoftext|> Oh I don't know if I heard of that one? What is it about? I watched Klaus the other day and it was actually really good like I can see it becoming a Christmas classic. <|endoftext|> It's about Kris Kringle's Daughter, where she wants to find her role, since her brother is Nick, who takes over for Santa eventually. Or is supposed to, if he was good at it! So I think it will have a lot of silly moments. <|endoftext|> Oh that definetely seems like something I would enjoy! Thanks for the recommendation - I accept it! Sounds kinda similar to what I watched last night, which was about Santa's daughter and how she wanted to go to college and not take over the family business. <|endoftext|> That sounds funny too! I hope you enjoy it! Getting into the Christmas spirit! <|endoftext|> Yes I am! <|endoftext|> I have another suggestion from, an older one that is just as silly as the newer one, called Bad Santa, have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> I have not seen that one <|endoftext|> It's a decent one, wacky adventures, a guy pretending to be santa and all the things that go with that. It's not as wholesome, but sometimes that's what makes it fun. <|endoftext|> hmmm I will consider it, could be funny but I think I do prefer wholesome. <|endoftext|> Hm, alright, what about Christmas Angel <|endoftext|> Hmm I think I saw the trailer to that and it seemed too cheesy or bad acting <|endoftext|> Oh here's one, the Night Before, it's got Seth Rogen in it, so it should be pretty funny. It's about the night before christmas, looking for a christmas party. <|endoftext|> oh seth rogen is funny! This is on netflix too? <|endoftext|> I am not sure! But would you want to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. How are you? <|endoftext|> i'm fine, how are you doing ? <|endoftext|> I'm doing pretty good. I here to help you find the best movie trailer based on your preference. <|endoftext|> well, my favorite actors are samuel l jackson, johnny depp, tom cruise, will smith and brad pitt to mention but a few. i prefer seeing action, adventure and vampire movies to watching comedy movies or highschool <|endoftext|> Which genre of movies do you like the most? <|endoftext|> i love seeing thriller/action movies <|endoftext|> I think you will like Cold Pursuit a lot. <|endoftext|> is it a new movie? <|endoftext|> This movie came out earlier this year back in February. <|endoftext|> okay , i will watch the trailer to know if i would watch the full movie or not <|endoftext|> I have another movie for you. Its called The Highwaymen. <|endoftext|> i'll check out the trailer, thanks . which of the two movies you mentioned earlier would you recommend for me to see. <|endoftext|> Cold Pursuit has good acting and a very good plot. I think its better than The Highwaymen <|endoftext|> so that is your recommendation? <|endoftext|> Yes it is. I think you will like it a lot. Liam Neeson does a very good job in this movie. <|endoftext|> okay , i accept cold pursuit as your movie recommendation <|endoftext|> Thanks. How often do you watch movies at the movie theater? <|endoftext|> yes at the theater and i do stream movies online <|endoftext|> Thats great. It was nice chatting with you today. I hope you enjoy Cold Pursuit. <|endoftext|> thank you, it was nice having this conversation with you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Are you interested in watching a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Hi! Yes I am! which movie? <|endoftext|> I can help you find a trailer for a movie you might be interested in watching. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I really like action movies and movies with great acting. <|endoftext|> Action movies are always exciting, especially when the actors are good too. What was the last action movie you saw? <|endoftext|> the last real action movie I saw was Avengers: End Game. It was awesome. something like that would be cool <|endoftext|> Avengers: End Game was a great movie, definitely one of my favorites from the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Let me see if I can find something similar that you will enjoy. <|endoftext|> okay, go for it! <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of the John Wick movies? John Wick Chapter 3- Parabellum came out this year and had great reviews (90% on Rotten Tomatoes!) <|endoftext|> ohhh yeah, i saw only the firs one, but would love to catch up with the series <|endoftext|> I have seen all 3 and would definitely recommend finishing the series! Keanu Reeves is a brilliant actor. If you're looking to catch up, would you like to watch the trailer for John Wick Chapter 2? <|endoftext|> Yes! I'd like to see it. <|endoftext|> Great! Hopefully you'll find it as exciting as the first film in the series. <|endoftext|> Do you have to see the second one to understand the third? <|endoftext|> It's not absolutely necessary, but I think you will enjoy the third movie more if you have as much background information as possible, so I would recommend watching them in order. Plus the second is a great movie too! <|endoftext|> Okay, that's a good tip. How is the acting? <|endoftext|> Very strong. Reeves gives great performances in both. <|endoftext|> thats great to hear. <|endoftext|> I'm glad to hear you're interested in watching the trailer and I'm happy I could make a recommendation for John Wick Chapter 2! <|endoftext|> I love and accept your recommendation! Thanks for your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, do you like movies? <|endoftext|> yes am a huge fan <|endoftext|> What type of movie do you enjoy most? <|endoftext|> i enjoy any good movie, i recently watched Frozzen 2 and it was preety good. how about you do you enjoy movies, what is your favorite <|endoftext|> I enjoy movies a lot. I think that the new movie about Mr. Rogers called A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood will be terrific <|endoftext|> it looks good, i don't kno that much about Mr.Rogers, i know Tom Hanks is in it. how about action any recomndations. <|endoftext|> Sure what action movie is your favorite? <|endoftext|> I like Terminator 2, i have not seen the new one yet, i know they got Linda Hammiltton to replay her part as Sarah Connor <|endoftext|> Yes, that is a really good choice. Are you interested in Batman? They have a new movie called Joker out by Marvel Comics <|endoftext|> Joker with Joaquin Phoenix is By D.C comocs <|endoftext|> Oh yes, I apologize. Yes, Phoenix plays the comedian who becomes mad after getting rejected by society. <|endoftext|> have you seen it <|endoftext|> I've seen previews in theaters. It looks very action packed and exciting seeing the demise of the comedian into a mad villainous Joker <|endoftext|> sounds good ill take your recomendation <|endoftext|> Great. I hope you'll love the excitement and character developments in the story. <|endoftext|> am sure i will. Thank you for your time <|endoftext|> It's been out since early October so if you want to see it in theaters now is the time. <|endoftext|> i might just wait until it comes out on video. i did not go see it on theater because i was worried it would be bad but i guess i was wrong <|endoftext|> Thanks for accepting my recommendation. <|endoftext|> no problem <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> See any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes! Joker! <|endoftext|> That was an awesome movie! <|endoftext|> Agreed. How about you? Any good ones on your end? Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> What do you prefer action movies? <|endoftext|> I don't prioritize them, but there are some classics -- Die Hard, Rambo, Alien/Predator, John Wick. All fantastic! <|endoftext|> I do have some recommendations for you! <|endoftext|> let's have 'em <|endoftext|> Avengers End Game was pretty epic and like 20 or so movies in the making!! <|endoftext|> Agree! Saw it 3x in theaters. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen OLD Boy a remake of an older Japanese movie? <|endoftext|> Wasn't Old Boy a Korean movie to begin with? <|endoftext|> Oh yea you're right. My bad. <|endoftext|> Haha. Yeah, I saw the original, but not the remake. That fight scene in the hallway is probably my top 5 favorite. <|endoftext|> Why not check out the remake and compare the two! I like the original better personally but they did a great job! <|endoftext|> Will do! <|endoftext|> Trailer comin at ya! It has Josh Brolin as main character! <|endoftext|> I know that much, PLUS a Spike Lee movie! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Great, what do you have to show me? <|endoftext|> Wha kind of movies do you prefer? <|endoftext|> I like comedies and suspense. I don't like horror. <|endoftext|> I used to love horror, not so much now. What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Knives Out. It was great. A nice mix of light moments and suspense. The acting was pretty good, not amazing. <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy animated comedies? Or perfer to keep watch more adult movies? <|endoftext|> I am open to either. I have kids so I see a lot of animation when going out with them. <|endoftext|> On the animated front, Frozen 2 had its moments of humor. Great music as well. And plenty of references for parents to catch. <|endoftext|> OK. I have not seen that yet. I would like to see that trailer. <|endoftext|> I do think you would enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Sounds good to me. Disney usually does a good job with their movies. <|endoftext|> They did a good job with this sequel. What actors do you enjoy watching? <|endoftext|> hmmm, I am so bad with actors names. As long as they are believable I am pretty open. <|endoftext|> I enjoy Helen Mirren. She has a new movie out too. This one is a drama/thriller. <|endoftext|> I think I will check out Frozen 2, thank you. <|endoftext|> That is a good choice. <|endoftext|> I am looking forward to viewing that. <|endoftext|> Okay, you're welcome. <|endoftext|> what is the movie with Helen Miren called? <|endoftext|> The Good Liar <|endoftext|> I never heard of it. What is it about? <|endoftext|> A con artist meets a widow and finds out she's well off. He finds himself caring about her, but there's more than meets the eye going on. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> helo <|endoftext|> Ok, I really could use a recommendation for a movie. Any trailers I should check out? <|endoftext|> yes check out the movie QUOTATION_MARKjokerQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> That's a good idea I do like the Batman stuff. Are there any other comic book movies I should check out? <|endoftext|> No that i know off <|endoftext|> I might check out Joker on my own. Are there any good movies for families and kids? <|endoftext|> frozen 2 <|endoftext|> Oh yeah Frozen 2! I really liked the story and the music in the first one. And of course, Olaf. I hope they have that character again from the outpost that was hilarious. <|endoftext|> yes it's a one of a kind movie and it's best to watch with family <|endoftext|> I definitely accept that Frozen 2 recommendation. Thanks very much! <|endoftext|> you are welcome <|endoftext|> Merry Christmas! <|endoftext|> Hope you enjoy the movie, thanks! <|endoftext|> Wait, I forgot about that maybe I want to see some Christmas movies too! <|endoftext|> CAts <|endoftext|> I'd be interested in seeing Cats because I always wanted to see the musical when I was a kid. Is it a movie of a staged version or just full out movie style? <|endoftext|> yes it's a best movie to watch in Christmas <|endoftext|> I bet the kids would like it too. Ok those are good recommendations I accept the Frozen 2 and Cats. Joker might be hard for me to get away to see it on my own. <|endoftext|> Well all three of them are good <|endoftext|> Fingers crossed I get to see all three! I hope you see lots of good movies too soon. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Hope you have fun. Bye <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, I hear you're looking for a movie? <|endoftext|> Hi, you heard right! <|endoftext|> What was the latest movie that you saw and liked? <|endoftext|> I watched Us recently and I liked that a lot <|endoftext|> Us is a great movie! Do you like horror movies in general? <|endoftext|> It depends - I don't like horror movies that are just gore or things jumping out, but I like movies that are suspenseful and keep you guessing <|endoftext|> Have you seen any Ari Aster movies? They're pretty scary and suspenseful. <|endoftext|> I've never heard of them - what are some of their movies? <|endoftext|> Midsommer and Hereditary, one is about a couple going to Sweden and finding a cult, and one is about a family haunted by demons. <|endoftext|> Oh okay! I've seen Hereditary and I've heard about Midsommer but I wasn't sure if I would like it - it seemed to get mixed reviews <|endoftext|> It's weird but visually really beautiful and worth watching. <|endoftext|> okay cool I'll maybe check it out! Do you have any other recommendations? I also like documentaries <|endoftext|> Jiro Dreams of Sushi is a really cute and fun documentary about a man who has a famous sushi restaurant. What kind of subjects do you like for documentaries? <|endoftext|> I usually like things that are more political or about something surprising - I recently watched Tell Me Who I Am and Fahrenheit 11/9 and I liked both of those, though I thought 11/9 was pretty biased <|endoftext|> There's a documentary called QUOTATION_MARKBehind the CurveQUOTATION_MARK which is about conspiracy theorists and is pretty fun and surprising. There's also a lot of climate change documentaries, although they can be pretty depressing. <|endoftext|> Behind the Curve sounds interesting - can you tell me a little more about it? <|endoftext|> It talks about people who think the earth is flat, and how that effects them and their lives as people push them away for seeming crazy. <|endoftext|> Oh wow. It's wild how QUOTATION_MARKflat earthersQUOTATION_MARK are such a big movement! <|endoftext|> Also, another horror movie you might like is The Witch, which is a very unique movie set in Puritan times. <|endoftext|> I think I might have seen that - is it sometimes written VVitch? <|endoftext|> Yeah, it has the weird title. <|endoftext|> Okay - I think I'll check out Midsommar. Thanks for the great recommendations! <|endoftext|> Hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi there, I am looking for a scary movie recommendation. Something that is big budget with big name actors. <|endoftext|> Are you looking for a newer or older scary block buster? <|endoftext|> a newer one. Something within the last 2-3 years. <|endoftext|> Ok do you have a preference of where it is set, such as space, earth or time period? <|endoftext|> I am interested in a horror film that is in an ordinary place. Somewhere that typically doesn't have scary experiences. <|endoftext|> Are you looking for jump scares or more suspenseful? <|endoftext|> I think suspenseful is better <|endoftext|> It from 2017 is the highest grossing horror movie of all time, would you be interested in it, or have you seen It before? <|endoftext|> I have seen IT already <|endoftext|> Bird Box is from 2018 with Sandra Bullock? <|endoftext|> Was that a Netflix movie? I think I had heard good things about it. I have not seen that one. <|endoftext|> Yes it is a Netflix film. I think you would enjoy it. It's in a ordinary place, it's suspenseful, and was made recently with a big name actor. <|endoftext|> Yes, that surely sounds like a good match. Is there a basic plot description you could provide? I have no idea what it is about. <|endoftext|> Five years after an ominous unseen presence drives most of society to suicide, a mother and her two children make a desperate bid to reach safety. <|endoftext|> Dang, that does sound good. I think we have a winner! <|endoftext|> Awesome that's great I hope you enjoy the movie, and you can do so in the comfort of your own home. I hope you have some popcorn ready! <|endoftext|> Yes, thank you for the great recommendation. I will go and watch that very soon. <|endoftext|> Great I am so happy to have helped in your quest for a movie. I feel like Netflix should have questions just like this to help you find things to watch since there is so much <|endoftext|> Yes, that is one of the big issues I have with Netflix. I spend 20-30 minutes just browsing. <|endoftext|> Ya and it makes you so tried you watch nothing lol <|endoftext|> Exactly. I really only hear of the best movies and shows by word of mouth or what is big in the news (Stranger Things) <|endoftext|> Exactly. Well I hope you enjoy, since I enjoyed our little chat. Good night <|endoftext|> Thank you, good night! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! Welcome. <|endoftext|> Hi. How are you? <|endoftext|> I am doing quite well today, thanks for asking. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I love action movies. The more it keeps you on the edge of your seat the better. <|endoftext|> Same here. I really enjoy the Fast and Furious movies, just because of how much they turn up the action. <|endoftext|> Oh yes. I definitely agree. So is there anything you can recommend for me that's new? <|endoftext|> Have you watched the new Terminator 6: Dark Fate trailer? <|endoftext|> No. I have not <|endoftext|> It got me excited for a Terminator movie for the first time in a long time. It looks like they really went all out. <|endoftext|> Oh really. Is it a all new cast or are there some of the old cast members in it? <|endoftext|> It looks like they went and cast a lot of the original cast in it, plus a lot of returning characters. They really take advantage of the Time Travel plot <|endoftext|> When does it come out? <|endoftext|> I'm not sure that the date has been announced yet but Google says next year, planned for summer. <|endoftext|> Ok. I will except your recommendation. I definitely can't wait for it to come out specially if it's better than the last. <|endoftext|> It honestly looks really good. Looks like there's going to be lots of different terminator models all fighting. Good CGI too. <|endoftext|> Ok. S <|endoftext|> Have fun! <|endoftext|> I definitely will when it comes out. <|endoftext|> Do you have a place to see it in 3D nearby? <|endoftext|> Yeah I do <|endoftext|> I do too, I think I'm going to give it a shot in 3D and see how good its become since it first came back. <|endoftext|> You know what I think that will be awesome specially if there going to have the different model fighting. <|endoftext|> Exactly. If the CGI looks that good, then the 3D might be pretty good too. <|endoftext|> Well thank you for the recommendation. I hope you enjoy the movie as well when it comes out. <|endoftext|> You as well. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> What type of films do you like? <|endoftext|> I really enjoy horror movies. <|endoftext|> Oh cool. I just watched 3 from Hell the other day <|endoftext|> I enjoyed House of 1000 Zombies, but didn't enjoy Devil's Rejects quite as much. So I'm a bit on the fence about 3 From Hell. <|endoftext|> I like all of Zombies stuff I'veseen. Maybe because I've got a crush on Sherry Moon Zombie. LOL <|endoftext|> LOL, I hear you there. I didn't like Lords of Salem, though. It seemed borderline incoherent. <|endoftext|> have you seen 31? <|endoftext|> I haven't. What's it about? <|endoftext|> it's a rob zombie joint that's like what wouldhavehappened if he directed running man <|endoftext|> Oh wow, that sounds neat. <|endoftext|> I really enjoed it. at first I thought it was the last chapter in the firefly family trilogy <|endoftext|> Does he re-use a lot of actors from the Firefly family movies? <|endoftext|> I think the only double in 31 was Sherri <|endoftext|> I'll watch it tonight; I was hoping someone could point me to something good. (I'm explicitly telling you that I accept your recommendation.) <|endoftext|> Thank you! I have the trailer selected <|endoftext|> Awesome. Hit me with it. <|endoftext|> I can't figureouthow. LOL <|endoftext|> It's all good. I can youtube it. I'm honestly not sure if you have to send me a link or not. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there! Have you seen any good movies recently? <|endoftext|> Yes! I am looking for a new one to go see? I love action adventure with a little of the supernatural. Looking for a recommendation/trailer:) <|endoftext|> Are you looking for something that is newer, or do you not care when it came out? <|endoftext|> I don't have a preference on release date...just looking for something with action. Sci-Fi would work, too! Any ideas?? <|endoftext|> I really enjoy all of the Marvel movies. One of my more recent favorite Marvel movies was Captain Marvel. I enjoyed the historical aspects of it as well as the difference that was a female lead. <|endoftext|> I loved Endgame..Captain Marvel is a great recommendation - it might even fill in the missing gaps for me in Endgame. I will take you up on that recommendation. Thank you!.. Is there a trailer for it? I was also thinking about the new Star Wars movie that is coming out on Dec 20th. Haven't see a trailer though. <|endoftext|> There is a trailer for Captain Marvel! Did you want me to find a link for it? I'm also looking forward to the new star wars movie, and have seen the trailers that they play every once and awhile on TV! <|endoftext|> If you have a link for Captain Marvel...that would be great! I'll keep a look out for the Star Wars Trailer, too. DId you know that Black Widow from the MCU is coming out with a movie in 2020? I would love to see that trailer!!! <|endoftext|> Here is a link to the captain marvel trailer! I heard that there was going to be a Black Widow movie coming out but I'm not sure how it's going to work becuase of what happened in Endgame - but I am excited to see it and see what happens! <|endoftext|> Thanks for the link and the recommendation. I will be watching Captain Marvel tonight. I think the Black Widow movie will be pre-Endgame and from a timeline standpoint occur between the 2 Avengers movies. Thanks again for the idea! <|endoftext|> You're Welcome! I'll be intrigued to see it! <|endoftext|> Any other movie ideas? I think we like the same genre! <|endoftext|> Hmm, I really enjoyed The Martian, which is less alien, but still takes place in space. That's a good one if you haven't seen it! <|endoftext|> Hmm..the Martian. Haven't seen it - is it with Matt Damon? I think I know that one. Another great recommendation. I'll take you up on that. Thanks! <|endoftext|> It is! I believe it came out about 4 years ago, but it's a very good movie. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat! <|endoftext|> Do you know anything about the movie Annihilation with Natalie Portman? I was also thinking about that one as well. <|endoftext|> I do not, actually! I've heard about it but never saw it. I'd be interested in it though! <|endoftext|> I loved her in Thor and Black Swann as well. Was also thinking about Blade Runner 20149. Thoughts or recommendations for that one? <|endoftext|> I've only seen the trailer for that one, but it seems pretty interesting as well! I love movies - just wish I had more time to watch them all! <|endoftext|> Same. Thanks for your suggestions. I have something to watch this weekend! <|endoftext|> You're welcome! Me too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> action movies and comedy are my top 2 favorite genres <|endoftext|> Awesome! What was the last action or comedy movie you watched? <|endoftext|> My Name is Dolemite <|endoftext|> Did you like it? I personally thought it was pretty good. <|endoftext|> I did too. I was glad to see Eddie Murphy in something good again. <|endoftext|> Yes! I felt the exact same way. <|endoftext|> Because of it, Netflix is finally making a 4th Beverly Hills Cop movie. One of my top favorite action comedy movies is the first one. <|endoftext|> Wow I didn't know that. The first one is a classic. <|endoftext|> The second one is awesome as well. However I did not like the 3rd one. Do you recommend any movies like it? <|endoftext|> Hmmm. Have you seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang? <|endoftext|> I've heard of it I think. Is that the one with Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr? <|endoftext|> Yes. It's a fun dark comedy crime film also set in California. <|endoftext|> That's sounds like a good one. Any other dark comedies you recommend? <|endoftext|> In the same vein as that I'm a big fan of Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch' and 'Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Very funny and plenty of action! <|endoftext|> I don't think I've seen either of those although I feel like I should have. I know Lock Stock is referenced  in some of the shows i have watched. <|endoftext|> They are both similar in tone and style. I would start with Lock Stock first and if you enjoy that you'd probably enjoy Snatch <|endoftext|> That sounds good. I think I will give that one a shot! Thank you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there, how are you doing? <|endoftext|> Good I am looking for a trailer <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you like best? <|endoftext|> I love anything pre 2001, especially horror. I mean classic horror <|endoftext|> Same here, I really like classic horror films. How about actors, any favorites? <|endoftext|> I like a lot. In particular, I like John Cazale and Laurence Olivier, but they are not from any good horror movies <|endoftext|> How about directors, any preferences? <|endoftext|> Stanley Kubrick, John Landis <|endoftext|> Good call, two of my favorites as well. <|endoftext|> I like slashers, monster movies, ghost movies, all of the above really. Brian de Palma is great as well. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I think so. But, what movie? You did not offer any <|endoftext|> I am sorry, I am trying to figure this thing out. I selected 'Rosemary's BabyQUOTATION_MARK from 1968. <|endoftext|> Oh, great movie. I'd love to see that one. <|endoftext|> Nice! I think you would really like it based on your preferences/ <|endoftext|> I will check that one out. I think I just need one <|endoftext|> I think the director is really good too, strange person, but good director <|endoftext|> Yes, Roman Polanski is a great director. <|endoftext|> I think Mia Farrow is excellent in it as well. <|endoftext|> I love her as an actress. I appreciate that. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good morning. <|endoftext|> howdy <|endoftext|> Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> no can you recommend some for me? <|endoftext|> Do you like Action movies? <|endoftext|> yes I do <|endoftext|> Do you like Super Hero movies? <|endoftext|> absolutely I do <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of the Marvel Universe? <|endoftext|> Yes those are some of my favorite movies to watch <|endoftext|> Would you like Avengers Infinity War? <|endoftext|> I have seen it but I would love to watch it again. The Guardians of the Galaxy are my favorite characters. I really do enjoy the action scenes and music in this movie. I could watch it a thousand times over. Thank you, I accept your recommendation :D <|endoftext|> Great. Guardians of the Galaxy would have been my second recommendation. <|endoftext|> The music is the best, isn't it? Great films. Thank you for your time! <|endoftext|> You are very welcome. <|endoftext|> Have a great day! <|endoftext|> You too. <|endoftext|> Hope you enjoy your holiday season. <|endoftext|> Thanks. <|endoftext|> You are welcome <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you! I'm here to help you find a cool movie trailer to watch! What kind of movies do you enjoy watching? <|endoftext|> Hello! I like Comedy, Heroes and History Movies <|endoftext|> Awesome! When you say history movies, do you mind if they are war movies? <|endoftext|> I used to like war movies but now I like them about 20% <|endoftext|> Okay! What kind of heroes do you like? Do you like the Marvel/DC Universe type heroes? Or are you open to other kinds? For example, have you heard of I Am Number Four? <|endoftext|> Yes I like the Marvel heroes. Never heard of QUOTATION_MARK I am Number FourQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Awesome! I am Number Four is an exciting and gripping movie about these persons that have powers called QUOTATION_MARKlegacies.QUOTATION_MARK It is based off of a book series. The movie received a lot of good reviews from people that enjoy hero and action. Watching the film actually made me read the series. The trailer is here, if you want to check it out and let me know what you think! <|endoftext|> How Many series are there?? And yes I can check the trailer. <|endoftext|> This movie is based off of the first novel in a seven novel series! I really hope they make movies out of the sequels. This, in my opinion, was an underrated film. It isn't as crazy intricate as Marvel/DC movies are, but it definitely does have very exciting sequences and puts a nice little smile on your face at the end. The trailer can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_U6ctjOaic <|endoftext|> OH wow the movie look very interesting, I wanna see it. Do you have any other recommendation? <|endoftext|> Yes! Have you ever seen the movie Hancock with Will Smith? It is an awesome movie about a homeless superhero who doesn't know how to use his powers responsibly, and his growth as he becomes a better superhero. <|endoftext|> Yeah I have seen That one. <|endoftext|> Awesome! That was a fun movie. Speaking of fun, have you heard about the new Eddie Murphy comedy coming out? It is called Dolemite Is My Name. I am putting it up in a recommendation if you would like to check it out! <|endoftext|> Yes i have heard of it. And yeah go ahead <|endoftext|> Awesome! Historical films are a little bit tougher, since most of the recent historical films seem to all revolve around major wartime events, for example, the movie 1917 that is going to be releasing soon. However, I have a film you may be interested that isn't quite war based! There is a movie named QUOTATION_MARKThe KingQUOTATION_MARK that is available on Netflix! It has received some great reviews, especially for it's cinematography and beautiful camera shots. It has an impressive cast. <|endoftext|> What is the movie (The King) about?? <|endoftext|> The story is about Hal, son of King Henry, who is a wayward prince and he reluctantly becomes King after his father passes away. He has to adapt to everything that a King is responsible for: politics, war, relationships, and ruling people! <|endoftext|> It looks interesting. The King looks like the guy in Games of Thrones. Isn't it?? <|endoftext|> That is interesting you say that! While the actor, Timothee Chalamet is not in Game of Thrones, the movie has a LOT of similarities with Game of Thrones! A lot of people that watched that movie enjoyed it because they enjoy the rawness that the movie has, much like Game of Thrones! <|endoftext|> I could have sworn he is in Game of Thrones. When is the movie coming out??? <|endoftext|> The movie is already out! It is in some select theaters, but you can watch it on Netflix, it is already on there. <|endoftext|> Alright Thank you. I will definitely watch tonight or Tomorrow after work. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> Hello how are you <|endoftext|> I am well thanks. I am here to give you a hand finding a movie trailer you might like. <|endoftext|> Ok. Are you into specific movies yourself <|endoftext|> Sure, I like sci-fi movies a lot like Star Wars for example, what about you? <|endoftext|> I am military viewer myself <|endoftext|> I see, what is your favorite military movie? <|endoftext|> Heartbreak Ridge <|endoftext|> Oh that's a good one. Clint Eastwood is really good in that movie. <|endoftext|> Yes he plays a great role as a Marine <|endoftext|> Have you seen Platoon? <|endoftext|> Yes, but years ago <|endoftext|> Ok, what about Full Metal Jacket? It's a Kubrick film so it may not be for everyone. <|endoftext|> It was great. Do you remember the lead actor <|endoftext|> Wasn't it Matthew Modine? <|endoftext|> What about the Marine Gunny. Do you remember him? <|endoftext|> R Lee Ermey I think it was <|endoftext|> Yes. He just passed away <|endoftext|> That's terrible. Going back a bit a couple I can think of are The Longest Day, Patton is really good and a newer film is American Sniper. <|endoftext|> They are good. They just made a remake of Midway <|endoftext|> Would you like to see a trailer for any of these? <|endoftext|> Sure. Midway <|endoftext|> Awesome, I've heard good things about it. <|endoftext|> Also you could get me Longest Day <|endoftext|> There is actually no trailer for that sadly... <|endoftext|> American Sniper <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! What is the last movie that you saw? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw was Avengers: End Game. <|endoftext|> Do you normally prefer movies based on comics? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do. I really enjoy actions movies, in general. <|endoftext|> What do you like about them? <|endoftext|> I like the fast pace of the film. I like watching someone do something on screen that I can't. <|endoftext|> Same here! Joker is a really great origin story, but if you like an action-packed comedy, I'd really recommend Zombieland 2. <|endoftext|> I've heard really good things about Joker. It may be a bit too dark for me. What is the plot about? <|endoftext|> It pretty much shows how the Joker fit into society when he was trying to function as a normal human being, and it gives insight on his mental illness and background as a clown-like character. It is kind of dark, which definitely makes sense to his character. <|endoftext|> Hm, sounds very interesting. I do like comic book movies as well. What is the plot of Zombieland 2? <|endoftext|> Zombieland 2 is a sequel to Zombieland, where strangers are brought together as a survival team in the zombie apocalypse. The second movie shows them years later as they have grown into more of a family unit, and some drama threatens their relationship. <|endoftext|> The plot sounds pretty scary and funny. Who stars in Zombieland 2? <|endoftext|> Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. <|endoftext|> Wow, I really like Woody Harrelson's acting. That sounds like a good movie. Who was the director? <|endoftext|> It's directed by Ruben Fleischer. Zombieland is his best known movie! <|endoftext|> Did you see the 1st film? Do you think I would have to see the 1st film to understand the 2nd? <|endoftext|> I did see the first film, but everything is explained pretty well in the second one so you wouldn't need to see the first film to understand. <|endoftext|> That sounds good. I'll accept your recommendation of Zombieland 2. <|endoftext|> Great! I think you'll enjoy it. <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will thanks to you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you find a movie to watch. <|endoftext|> I am looking for an action type movie <|endoftext|> Do you like superhero movies? <|endoftext|> I do, but I was thinking something more spy thiller <|endoftext|> James Bond movies are a great option for that, and there are a ton of those movies to choose from. <|endoftext|> I like Bond, maybe one of the older one's. What is your favorite one? <|endoftext|> My personal favorite is Casino Royale, one of the more contemporary ones. However, Goldfinger is close second and came out in the 60's, so pretty old! <|endoftext|> I like that one, where he robs the Federal Reserve. Sweet, good choice, that is what I will go with, Goldfinger <|endoftext|> I'm glad to hear that! I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thanks, I think it will be a great movie night. <|endoftext|> It appears I can't find the film anywhere online, I think Casino Royale would be a great second choice if that works for you. In my opinion, Daniel Craig is an even better Bond than Sean Connery. <|endoftext|> I think that will work, as that particular one does a good job channeling the older Bond films. Thanks for the effort, and recommendation. <|endoftext|> Of course, it was my pleasure. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the Bond where he gets married? It is the one with the one-off Bond actor, in-between Connery and Moore <|endoftext|> I dont think I have, what year did it come out? <|endoftext|> 69, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. He is seen as the Bond closest to the character based in Fleming's Books about Bond <|endoftext|> Thats interesting, considering it seems very out of his playboy character to get married. <|endoftext|> Definitely, it is a different Bond, in tone. If you like Bond, and want a goofy version check out, In Like Flint, reminds me of an early Austin Powers <|endoftext|> That's a great recommendation, thank you! I was a big fan of Austin Powers as a kid, but I think I saw it a little too young as a lot of the jokes went over my head. <|endoftext|> Cool, seems like we both have a good movie to go watch. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm here to help you find a trailer! <|endoftext|> Sounds great, what do you recommend? <|endoftext|> Hmm depends. What kinda genre are you looking for? <|endoftext|> I prefer a suspense movie <|endoftext|> Oh those are good ones! What was the last one you watched? <|endoftext|> I just watched Shutter Island, big fan <|endoftext|> That was a good movie! You must like the edge of your-seat-kind of suspense. I'd totally recommend the movie Split! <|endoftext|> What is that about? <|endoftext|> It's a man that has around 25 different personalities that are trying to make the world QUOTATION_MARKpureQUOTATION_MARK. Watching the actor shift between characters really plays with your mind. <|endoftext|> Wow, that sounds interesting. Who's the main actor? Must have been hard to play 25 different people <|endoftext|> He's James McAvoy, he's also the younger Professor X from the X-Men movies. He dd an amazing job jumping between characters. He's the only actor ever to play so many in one film. <|endoftext|> I loved the X-Men movies. Do you have any recommendation on superhero movies as well? <|endoftext|> Hands down would be Deadpool and Deadpool 2 especially if you love the X-Men! <|endoftext|> I saw the first one, is Deadpool 2 about a similar plot? <|endoftext|> Only a little. It pushes more as a continuation from the first one. Deadpool actually gets a team together and learns the meaning of family. <|endoftext|> What do you think about the new Joker? <|endoftext|> To be honest, I haven't seen it yet but it's on my top list! I know it doesn't follow the DC line but it puts a human face to Joker which is something that has never been done. I love that kind of in depth cinema. I can't wait to see it. <|endoftext|> I just recently saw it and definitely think it's bound to get an Oscar nomination! What did you think off Avengers Endgame? <|endoftext|> That movie was insane! Utterly graphically insane! I loved it!! The did such a well rounded end it was such a surprise. <|endoftext|> Agreed! Well thank you for your recommendations! I accept your recommendations to watch Deadpool 2 and Split <|endoftext|> Aww fantastic! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like action movies. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> That is one of my favorite genres as well. Have you seen the John Wick movie series? <|endoftext|> I like the John Wick movie series. What is the latest one called? <|endoftext|> John Wick 3: Parabellum <|endoftext|> Can you tell me what the plot is about in this movie? <|endoftext|> It is about a hitman going for revenge. Starring Keanu Reeves. <|endoftext|> It looks like a good movie. Do you have any other action movie that I would like? <|endoftext|> Do you like the Avengers movies? They are some of my favorites as well. <|endoftext|> I do like the Avengers series. What is the latest movie called? <|endoftext|> Avengers: End Game <|endoftext|> What is the movie about? <|endoftext|> It is about the group of super heroes called the Avengers trying to prevent the end of the world caused by Thanos. <|endoftext|> Thanks. Who is starring in this movie? <|endoftext|> Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth. <|endoftext|> That is a very stromg cast. Which of the two movies that you recommended to me has the better plot? <|endoftext|> I would say that Avengers: End Game has a more interesting plot, while John Wick 3 has more realistic action sequences. <|endoftext|> Thanks. Which of the two movies has the better cast? <|endoftext|> I believe that Avengers: End game has a stronger cast. It is filled with stars that everyone would recognize. <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation for the Avengers: End Game movie <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, what type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> mostly horror <|endoftext|> see any good ones lately? <|endoftext|> Not lately because my wife doesn't like them but I've always liked Evil Dead <|endoftext|> Ha, Did you see It chapter 2? <|endoftext|> Lol, yes it's hilarious! <|endoftext|> Hilarious and scary! How about Midsommar? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen it. How is it? We watched IT a couple of weeks ago <|endoftext|> I thought it was weird, but falls into horror <|endoftext|> Lol....a lot of them are weird. I like the older horrors....they get gory <|endoftext|> How about Zombieland? <|endoftext|> Yeah, it was kind of weird too but scary. I like Final Destination too <|endoftext|> Yes, that was good, have you seen the Purge? <|endoftext|> Not yet but I'd like to. Isn't that a part of the conjuring? <|endoftext|> I think so, Ethan Hawke is an interesting actor <|endoftext|> Yes he is, no doubt. <|endoftext|> You should watch The Purge trailer <|endoftext|> Ok, I sure will right after this....I'll have to watch it while my wife is sleeping lol <|endoftext|> Ha yes <|endoftext|> I was born on Halloween, so it's natural for me to like horror lol <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! What kinds of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> I'm a big fan of science fiction and action movies. What's good right now? <|endoftext|> Are you more into serious action or comedic action? <|endoftext|> Probably more action comedy. Movies like Lethal Weapon or Rush Hour where there's a lot of action, but also some great laugh lines. <|endoftext|> There's a new Bad Boys coming out in January. The first two were very much in the Lethal Weapon/Rush Hour school of action. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! I remember seeing a couple of trailers for that. That's perfect. I accept this recommendation. <|endoftext|> Excellent! I hope you enjoy the film. <|endoftext|> Me too. Will Smith's been in a bunch of good movies lately, so hopefully this one's good too. <|endoftext|> I'm looking forward to Spies in Disguise, his new animated movie. That could also be an action comedy, though I get more comedy than action. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I feel like Spies in Disguise is more of a kids' movie. Not that that's a bad thing, just not quite my thing. <|endoftext|> Did you see either of the previous Bad Boys movies? <|endoftext|> Yes. I enjoyed them both. I think Bad Boys is a good recommendation. <|endoftext|> What other types of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> Science fiction! Serenity, Star Trek, that sort of thing. <|endoftext|> How do you feel about Star Wars? <|endoftext|> Well, I have a son that we named Luke. Does that give you an idea?:) <|endoftext|> Excellent choice of name! I'll take it you've already got Rise of Skywalker on your calendar <|endoftext|> Definitely. The Last Jedi was pretty awful, but I'm hoping with JJ Abrams back at the helm, this one will be better. <|endoftext|> The part that got me in that one was the Leia/Mary Poppins bit. <|endoftext|> Lol, I hadn't thought of it that way. Now I won't be able to unthink it. Argh. For me it was mostly that the whole central conflict of the movie chase could have been avoided if Admiral Holdo wasn't a terrible commander. <|endoftext|> Let's see what happens in this next one. Are you a Browncoat, by chance? <|endoftext|> Is there any other good color? <|endoftext|> Thoughts on a reboot of Firefly? Another sequel of sorts? Perhaps focusing on Kaylee? <|endoftext|> I'd be skeptical at this point that they'd do it justice, but I'd be in. <|endoftext|> Why the skepticism? I don't disagree, just curious to learn your thoughts on the matter <|endoftext|> Just hard to catch lightning in a bottle like that. Especially since I don't think most of the original actors would be coming back at this point. Whole new cast and all that. But I'd be down with a prequel or reboot, sure. <|endoftext|> Fair point. I'm glad that the recommendation for Bad Boys works well for you. Enjoy the trailer (and the film)! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. I'm here to make some good movie recomendations. <|endoftext|> hi, thankyou for being here <|endoftext|> What kind of movie trailers do you usually like? <|endoftext|> feel good family stories <|endoftext|> I have a good movie for you that I think you will like. I recommend the Lion King <|endoftext|> I have heard about the movie. but didn't watched it earlier. Can kids watch the movie? <|endoftext|> Yes. This is a classic family movie. <|endoftext|> ok. My kids want the movie to have happy ending. How about this one? <|endoftext|> It does have a happy ending and I think your kids will love it. <|endoftext|> Thank you for the recommendation. I Accept This. <|endoftext|> Thanks. I do have other movies for you and your kids as well <|endoftext|> Oh, I am interested in listening <|endoftext|> I would also recommend Toy Story 4.

Sorry. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, what are your favorite types of movies? <|endoftext|> Hello Action movies are my favorite movies <|endoftext|> Great! I enjoy action movies as well. What is the last action movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Avengers End Game was the last action movie I saw. <|endoftext|> Marvel movies are fun and full of action. What is your favorite Marvel character? <|endoftext|> That's a tough one. I'n not sure if I have one favorite. I like Iron Man and Captian Marvel the most. <|endoftext|> For the next movie you watch, are you interested in the same type of genre or a different one? <|endoftext|> I am pretty open to most movies, the only movies I don't like are horror movies <|endoftext|> Yeah, I don't enjoy horror either. But I can enjoy Sci-Fi or thrillers if they are not too gory. Do you watch thriller or sci-fi movies as well? <|endoftext|> Yes I watch both. <|endoftext|> I remember earlier you said Captain Marvel is one of your favorite characters. Would you like to watch the trailer for QUOTATION_MARKCaptain MarvelQUOTATION_MARK? It has Brie Larson and Samuel L Jackson <|endoftext|> Sure I would watch the trailer <|endoftext|> Thank you! It was fun chatting with you. <|endoftext|> Thank You <|endoftext|> I just had a few follow up questions and comments. The movie was one of the highest grossing movies this year. Did you see Avenger's Endgame in the theatre? <|endoftext|> Yes I did. <|endoftext|> Do you prefer to see movies in theatres or streaming? <|endoftext|> In Theatres <|endoftext|> Same, it seems to make the movie experience more immersive. I appreciate all the information you gave to me today. <|endoftext|> Yes it does. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> How are you doing tonight? <|endoftext|> Great I am looking for a movie <|endoftext|> Great!

It was action packed and emotional and rated PG-13, so it's appropriate for most kids. My 10 year-old nephew loved it. <|endoftext|> That movie sounds interesting I heard it had great action scenes and has Tom Holland <|endoftext|> It does! It has a star studded cast. Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and the list goes on and on! You should give it a shot. <|endoftext|> I definitely will check out that movie. It sounds like a strong acting class and perfect to what I want. <|endoftext|> Great! I'm glad I could help. Have a good night. Enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> I love the action portions. I heard that Robert downey jr was great in that movie <|endoftext|> He is!

It is a long movie, but it goes by quickly because there's never really a dull moment. <|endoftext|> Great thank for the recommendations <|endoftext|> You're welcome! So you're going to watch it? <|endoftext|> Definitely <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, My name is Matt and i am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi Matt, nice to meet you! <|endoftext|> nice to meet you aswell.

Any other movies like that, that I might like? <|endoftext|> I am Legend with Will smith, i like the version of vampires in this movie, vampires created by science in look for a cure for cancer <|endoftext|> oh wow that sounds like a good storyline. Is that the one where he is all alone? <|endoftext|> yes he is alone in Manhatthan, i like the relatioship between him Will Smith and his dog. Am a dog person <|endoftext|> okay I will see about watching that one for sure. I do like will smith's movies so should be good. I always like him in I, Robot <|endoftext|> I, Robot is an amazing film, if you liked him on that you will defenetly enjoy I am Legend. he has to carry most of the film on his own and the twist at the end is also good <|endoftext|> i can only imaigine how hard it would be to carry that whole  movie alive. <|endoftext|> he does a graet job, the dog does well too <|endoftext|> Any other suggestions? <|endoftext|> movies like I am legend not too many, still about vampires there is the movie called Let me in, its the story about a child vare and the friendship she makes with a ordinary boy <|endoftext|> i've seen that on hulu to watch but wasn't sure about it <|endoftext|> its great, A youg Chloe Grace Moretz pays the vampire and she befriends a bullied boy played by Kodi Smith. i enjoy the interaction of this two caracters <|endoftext|> oh I like that young lady in movies.

How are you doing today? I am here to try to find a movie trailer that you would like to view. Are you ready? <|endoftext|> Hello! I am well, thanks! I am ready! <|endoftext|> First off, what is your favorite kind of movie to watch - drama, action, comedy, etc? <|endoftext|> I definitely don't care a lot for drama. I would say horror/thriller, action, and comedy are probably my favorite genres. <|endoftext|> Those are my favorites too! Have you seen the latest Mission Impossible with Tom Cruise? <|endoftext|> I haven't yet, but I can't say that I have loved the most recent ones. Certainly jam packed with action, but not as high on my list. <|endoftext|> I would have to agree with you on this. I think half of the movie was chase scenes of one sort or another. <|endoftext|> It can be fun, but bot when it takes up most of the movie. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the Jack Reacher movies with Tom Cruise? While I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan, I am a big fan of the Lee Child's book character Jack Reacher. And the latest Jack Reacher movie - QUOTATION_MARKNever Go BackQUOTATION_MARK has a great plot. <|endoftext|> I am unfamiliar with it. While I don't specifically look for Tom Cruise movies, I can't say that I find his work poor. This sounds interesting. <|endoftext|> You should watch the trailer - I think it came out in 2016. If you like the trailer, I highly recommend the movie. And if you like the movie, I very highly recommend the book series by Lee Child! <|endoftext|> Can you tell me any more about the overall ratings or any other stars in the movie besides Cruise? <|endoftext|> The plot is - Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name while on the run as a fugitive from the law. Besides Tom Cruise, the movie stars Cobie Smulders and Aldis Hodge. I am not sure of the star rating, but I liked it! <|endoftext|> Thanks for that information. I am definitely interested in this and accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great! Glad I could help! Hope you enjoy the trailer and enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> Thanks again. Do you happen to know how many movies are out about this character? <|endoftext|> There are two in this series so far, with a new one out soon. The first was QUOTATION_MARKJack ReacherQUOTATION_MARK in 2012 and then Jack Reacher: Never Go BackQUOTATION_MARK in 2016. <|endoftext|> Awesome. So If I like it, there are additional ones to watch! <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? I think its maybe 2 and 1/2 minutes long. <|endoftext|> Absolutely! I'm looking forward to it and thanks again. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! what types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Hi, I like to watch horror and action movies. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched and liked or didn't like? <|endoftext|> last movie i watched was Ford vs Ferrari, I enjoyed that movie. <|endoftext|> For watching movie trailers, do you want a similar movie or a different one? <|endoftext|> different one, something like a scary movie. <|endoftext|> Ok, great. I like scary movies too! <|endoftext|> you can recommend any scary movie that is good. <|endoftext|> I liked the Movie IT it was good. <|endoftext|> i loved that movie with the clown. <|endoftext|> So you like horror movies and I would recommend Truth or Dare, have you seen it? <|endoftext|> no i havent, but am willing to watch it. <|endoftext|> Great, it's about a group of college kids that play truth or dare and if they lie or refuse something bad happens to them, it's very scary. <|endoftext|> ill watch it. <|endoftext|> Great! So do you also want to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> sure thing. <|endoftext|> Great choice, you are really going to like this one. Any other questions about the movie? <|endoftext|> nope that is it. <|endoftext|> Awesome, I hope you enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> thanks. im sure I will. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you pick out a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Great, I'd like a crime thriller. <|endoftext|> That's great! What was the last one you have seen? <|endoftext|> I just saw The Irishman. I loved it! <|endoftext|> Awesome! That's on my to watch list. <|endoftext|> Martin Scorsese is such a legend. Do you have any Scorsese films you could recommend? <|endoftext|> One of my favorites was Shutter Island. That's a pretty old movie though, so I'm assuming you've already seen that. <|endoftext|> No, I haven't actually. What's it about? <|endoftext|> Oh it's great! It stars Leonardo DiCaprio. It's about a murderess who has appeared to have vanished from an insane asylum located on a remote island <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great recommendation! I'd like to see the trailer for it! <|endoftext|> Perfect. I hope you enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> One more thing, can you also recommend a good family Christmas movie? <|endoftext|> One of my favorites is Christmas with the Kranks. It's such a touching story about a family's love for their daughter and the true meaning of friendship/Christmas. <|endoftext|> I've never seen that one. Is it a recent movie, or an older one? <|endoftext|> It's an older one. It came out in 2004. It stars Tim Allen (One of my favorite actors) and Jamie Lee Curtis <|endoftext|> Oh, they are both really good. What happens to the daughter in the movie? <|endoftext|> She decides to surprise her family for Christmas. She had been working in Peru and didn't think she was going to be home for Christmas that year. <|endoftext|> I'd like to see the trailer for that one, too. You've given me two good ones to choose from. Thank you! <|endoftext|> I will see what I can do! <|endoftext|> Terrific - thanks so much! <|endoftext|> You're very welcome! Have a great night! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm hoping to help recommend a movie to you. <|endoftext|> Hi, wonderful. I like dramas, documentaries, and action films. <|endoftext|> What is your favorite film? <|endoftext|> The Ref <|endoftext|> What do you like about that movie? <|endoftext|> It's a dark comedy about a family on the verge of falling apart. <|endoftext|> Have you heard of The Royal Tenenbaums? That is also a dark comedy about a dysfunctional family. <|endoftext|> Yes I have. <|endoftext|> Did you like it? Would you enjoy a similar film? <|endoftext|> I like this recommendation. Yes, I would enjoy a similar film. <|endoftext|> You might like The Meyerowitz Stories, about An estranged family gathers together in New York City for an event celebrating the artistic work of their father. <|endoftext|> Perfect. I like the Meyerowitz Stories. <|endoftext|> Glad you want to watch! <|endoftext|> Are there more movies like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Meyerowitz Stories you recommend? <|endoftext|> Kicking and Screaming is by the same director as The Meyerowitz Stories. It is about a bunch of guys hang around their college for months after graduation, continuing a life much like the one before graduation. <|endoftext|> The director, Noah Baumbach? <|endoftext|> Yes, Noah Baumbach. <|endoftext|> Hmm. What about The Grand Budapest Hotel or something similar? <|endoftext|> Have you heard of In Bruges? It is a dark comedy and feels somewhat similar to Grand Budapest in its humor. <|endoftext|> Thank you for your help. I like In Bruges as well. <|endoftext|> Great! Glad you want to accept the recommendation. <|endoftext|> I accept :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> good morning, how are you? <|endoftext|> Hi, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm fine.

Family friendly is also good for me. <|endoftext|> What's the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Dora the Explorer. <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy animated movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, but not all the time. I like live action movies too. <|endoftext|> I like animated movies, looking forward to seeing the next Toy Story. Have you seen them? <|endoftext|> I've already seen all the Toy Story movies so you're on the right track but I'll need a different recommendation. I did enjoy that movie and I like Tom Hanks and Keanu Reeves. They were both in the last Toy Story. <|endoftext|> Have you heard of the upcoming movie Spies in Disguise? <|endoftext|> I think I saw a commercial for it. Can you tell me more about it? I think this could be a good movie for me. <|endoftext|> Starring Will Smith. When the world's best spy is turned into a pigeon, he must rely on his nerdy tech officer to save the world. <|endoftext|> I like Will Smith and the plot of a human turned into a pigeon sounds funny. This is perfect recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> I'm looking forward to seeing it, it sounds funny. I really like Will Smith movies, especially Men in Black. <|endoftext|> I like Men in Black too and Independence Day. Thanks for your help. I will watch Spies in Disguise. Good bye. <|endoftext|> Okay, Hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thanks, I appreciate your help. <|endoftext|> Spies in Disguise also stars Karen Gillian, I'm not sure who she is. <|endoftext|> OMG she is from Doctor Who! She is also Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy. <|endoftext|> I guess I need to watch Doctor Who and Guardians of the Galaxy. I wonder how well she will be received in an animated movie. Hope she has a good voice. <|endoftext|> I think she will be great. She can change her voice so it should be good. She is British, or Scottish. As Nebula she has more of an American accent. You should watch Guaridans, it's a good movie. Thanks again and have a good day. <|endoftext|> Okay, have a nice day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! Did you enjoy a nice Thanksgiving? <|endoftext|> Hello! Yes, I had a very pleasant and nice Thanksgiving. Same for you I hope? <|endoftext|> Yes, yes. It's one of the times my family actually sits and watches a movie. We love Disney movies. Do you? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I enjoyed Disney movies a lot growing up but haven't seen any of the newer ones recently. I was maybe thinking of watching some of them though. <|endoftext|> What type movies to you typically enjoy? <|endoftext|> I'll watch any movie to be honest. Though I like actions, comedy, historical or sci-fi films the most. A nice looking animated film is also pleasant to look at. <|endoftext|> Same here. Who do you usually watch movies with? I often watch with my kids, but enjoy a night where I can see something with a more complicated plot. <|endoftext|> I live by myself, so I usually watch movies alone barring the rare time I have a friend or family member over or I'm at their place and we watch something. <|endoftext|> It would be nice to enjoy the quiet and watch a good historical movie. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was actually Us, the Jordan Peele directed film earlier this year. <|endoftext|> Oh, Maybe you would like Get Out also directed by Jordan Peele <|endoftext|> I've seen that already. I would actually wanted to watch something lighter after seeing Us. Maybe a newer Disney film from the past few years since you mentioned that earlier. <|endoftext|> If you haven't seen any of the newer Disney movies, I think you would enjoy Frozen and also Frozen 2 that is currently in theaters. It is one of the best Disney movies. <|endoftext|> How is Frozen as a movie? All I know about it is the Let it Go and Build a Snowman songs? <|endoftext|> It is a little different in that it isn't the traditional saved by the prince. It is about the strength in family/sibling love. But, there are some great comedic moments as well. And, the music is really good. <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting. Would you recommend I see over the other Disney animated films from the last few years? It is the best one? <|endoftext|> I feel it is the best one. <|endoftext|> Okay then. I will watch it next time I get the chance over the next few days. <|endoftext|> Yes, I would recommend Frozen. You will enjoy. <|endoftext|> Thank you for the recommendation. You've been a great help. I will let you know how I like it. <|endoftext|> Warning, the music will definitely go through your head lol. But, I love Idina Menzels voice. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Good, how are you? <|endoftext|> great! what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Comic book moves are my favorite now, but I also like comedies and action movies. <|endoftext|> okay! perfect. have you watched any good movies recently? <|endoftext|> I re-watched Avengers Endgame last week. I can't get enough. <|endoftext|> I've heard great things about that series. I have not seen too many action movies recently <|endoftext|> What do you like? Can you recommend any movies? <|endoftext|> I like comedies and drama as well as animated movies. I would definitely recommend the Lion King that was released this year. The soundtrack was wonderful and i loved the graphics <|endoftext|> I saw the original but have not seen the remake yet. I would love to watch it however as I hear it is quite good. Thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> I would also recommend assassin's creed. I think this may be right down your alley <|endoftext|> Video game movies are tough. I do like the Resident Evil movies, and Michael fassbender is an awesome actor. I will check this movie out as well. Was there anything bad about the movie? Did it end well? <|endoftext|> reviews were mixed but it did win a few awards. How about the x-men: apocalypse movie? <|endoftext|> That I did see. Again, Michael fassbender. I am a comic fan first, so it was a bit odd, but a movie I enjoyed. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the most recent Joker movie? I think this would be a great movie for you to check out. <|endoftext|> I have. It was technically a comic book movie, but the whole untrustworthy narrator plot took away some of it. I had no idea at the end if it was real or not. Plus, I doubt it will tie into any other movies. <|endoftext|> I would recommend aquaman if you haven't already seen it. Jason Momoa is a great actor <|endoftext|> I have seen this. It might be my favorite DC based movie. It was bright when it needed to be and had some character development. <|endoftext|> Great! i agree. Have you seen Dark Phoenix? <|endoftext|> I have. It was fun in the theater. Once I got home and thought about it they could have done a lot more. They got the cosmic feel better than X-Men three, but they didn't look at it from Jean Grey's perspective. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey! How's it going? <|endoftext|> Very good! How about yourself? <|endoftext|> Doing well. I hear you are interested in movies? <|endoftext|> I love movies! Definitely one of my passions <|endoftext|> Same! It's what my degree is in, actually. Do you have a favorite genre? <|endoftext|> I like indie and coming of age stories. I'm also always down for a good horror film. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the film Us? Got some interesting family dynamics, which is also important in all of the good coming of age films, etc. Definitely far from a conventional horror narrative and it is willing to push boundaries, so that gives off the indie QUOTATION_MARKvibeQUOTATION_MARK, etc. Think you might like it! <|endoftext|> Yes I did see it! I thought Lupita Nyongo's performance was amazing. And definitely agree about the family dynamics part. <|endoftext|> Got it. Nice! The next suggestion isn't quite coming-of-age, but definitely small-budget and terrifying in a QUOTATION_MARKpsychological thrillerQUOTATION_MARK kind of way... Ever seen Pi by Darren Aronofsky? <|endoftext|> No I haven't! But I love psychological thrillers, what's that one about? <|endoftext|> Seen ANY Aronofsky films? They all have some thematic similarities. Pi is about a guy's obsession with number theory, to summarize it VERY briefly. <|endoftext|> yes! I've seen Black Swan and Mother! Both were absolutely excellent and so unsettling <|endoftext|> I definitely suggest Pi then. It's a little more claustrophobic than Black Swan, but in a way that suits the obsession theme well. <|endoftext|> it sounds so good. I definitely am interested in that and accept that recommendation <|endoftext|> Sounds great! Enjoy! I wrote a scholarly article on Aronofsky and am definitely a fan. I hope you are too! Check out all of his stuff once you get time to. <|endoftext|> I absolutely will. Thanks again for this recommendation! You know your stuff! <|endoftext|> With movies, at least. Terribly QUOTATION_MARKunderinformedQUOTATION_MARK about other sides of life. Anyhow, hope you enjoy. <|endoftext|> Haha I am the same way. <|endoftext|> Everyone has specialties. Just don't obsess over any of them to the point where you become like Pi's main character! I think I can safely say that without spoiling it. Happy viewing. <|endoftext|> thanks again! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hey! How are you? I'm looking for a movie recommendation. It's Monday, and I am bored. Have you seen any movies lately? What could you recommend? <|endoftext|> Am Fine, Yes! have you seen the movie Gemini Man <|endoftext|> No!! What do you know about it? Sounds interesting. I love sci-fi, fantasy, action/adventure..is there a trailer for that movie? <|endoftext|> Yes there is a trailer on youtube, It is a movie by Will Smith and it is ation <|endoftext|> Love Will Smith! I will have to look for that trailer. Do you know when it was released? Recently? <|endoftext|> It was relaesed recently <|endoftext|> Oh, is that the one where the used CGI to create a younger Will Smith? <|endoftext|> Yes did you watch it already? <|endoftext|> No, but my husband was talking about a new Will Smith movie and I wondered if that was it. Thanks for a great recommendation. I will be watching. Any other suggestions? <|endoftext|> Did you watch The Equalizer? <|endoftext|> Is that the movie with Denzel Washington? I think I saw that one. <|endoftext|> Yes! did you liked it <|endoftext|> I did! He is a great actor. Do you know of any other movies he has done? <|endoftext|> Fences is a good one <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of that one. I will take a look for the trailer. Good suggestion. Do you plan to see the Black Widow movie that comes out next year? Part of the MCU? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen the trailer yet so i don't know what it's about <|endoftext|> I don't think there is a trailer but it supposed to be set between the first 2 avengers movies. A lot of people don't like the MCU, but I am a fan. I just basically love movies and I am glad for your two recommendations. <|endoftext|> You welcome! <|endoftext|> Have a great Monday! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I love indie, comedy, coming of age and thrillers. I also love horror! I am not a fan of action films or romance much. <|endoftext|> What was the last horror movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I saw Midsommar in theaters. I didn't think it was scary, more just upsetting, I really liked Hereditary which is from the same director. I've also been wanting to see It 2, I loved the original and the remake! <|endoftext|> I saw It 2 myself and it was fantastic! I think the casting was perfect <|endoftext|> oh my gosh YES! I am such a fan of Bill Hader too, I thought that was perfect. Did you see Get Out or Us? What did you think? I thought get out was phenomenal and Us was really scary but had lots of plot holes. I think he could've built the world a little better but I thought Lupita's performance was absolutely terrifying, she really made the movie for me. <|endoftext|> Us was probably one of the most terrifying films I've seen in a long time, not because of the film itself, but because of the theory of a secret world. <|endoftext|> and her voice?! Holy crap. That and her physical movements. I thought that was such a standout performance. Apparently she didn't tell anyone she was doing the voice like that until they started rolling and the other actors were absolutely terrified. <|endoftext|> She is amazing! based on your taste in films, i would recommend QUOTATION_MARKA Quiet PlaceQUOTATION_MARK, <|endoftext|> Wonderful. I absolutely adored A Quiet Place. The fact that they used a deaf actress and sign language was fantastic. I am heavily involved in the deaf community and know ASL myself, so I was so beyond pleased with the film and authentic representation of the deaf community. I accept! <|endoftext|> Amazing, thank you! <|endoftext|> Did you see Birdbox? I thought it was pretty well done as well even though it was a similar concept. <|endoftext|> I have but i was truly disappointed in the ending <|endoftext|> totally. I liked that they used blind people but it was a bit of a cop out ending. I also wanted to know why the crazy people from the mental hospital weren't affected? <|endoftext|> It seems like they ran out of ideas and wanted to fill time, a common thread for Netflix films <|endoftext|> haha absolutely. I watched tall girl because I knew it would be bad and boy was it. So so cheesy. <|endoftext|> What happened? <|endoftext|> It's literally a film about a girl in high school whose tall. That's the plot. About how it's so hard being 5'11 and no guy is tall enough for her. It was so ridiculous, if you need a good laugh I recommend. They took it so seriously too. Like being tall was a plague. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello! <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> whats up <|endoftext|> killing some time before I go home from work. How about you? <|endoftext|> yeah its super rainy here. I think a movie would be nice <|endoftext|> what kinds of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like scifi <|endoftext|> Nice, have you seen any good scifi movies lately? <|endoftext|> i saw starwars. What is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was the last Star Wars movie on Disney plus <|endoftext|> awesome. so you like scifi too? <|endoftext|> Some, my son and I watch Star Wars together a lot. I also like drama/action/history <|endoftext|> oh i was thinking of recommending mission impossible rogue nation. it's not too old but a great action movie <|endoftext|> what do you like about it? <|endoftext|> well.. it stars tom cruise which is a no brainer and the graphics and scale is very grandios <|endoftext|> I'm really not a huge fan of the mission impossible franchise, though. What else do you recommend? <|endoftext|> how about i am legend. It's a pretty old movie but its a action/thriller <|endoftext|> and it has some of the scifi element too <|endoftext|> yeah and its will smith baby! <|endoftext|> that sounds good, I'll check that one out. Thanks for your recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> DO you like drama? <|endoftext|> I do enjoy a good drama, actually. <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Joker? <|endoftext|> I've been under a rock, so I have not seen The Joker yet. Do you think it would be of interest to me? <|endoftext|> What types of movies do you normally watch? <|endoftext|> I often opt for movies that are realistic and grounded in their premises, and feature characters that don't cleanly fit into any stereotype <|endoftext|> Then I do think you would enjoy Joker <|endoftext|> Does The Joker have a good deal of action in it? <|endoftext|> Yes it does, It has drama action suspense <|endoftext|> You mentioned suspense, does it deliver the suspense well? <|endoftext|> Yes it is very intense <|endoftext|> Then I absolutely want to watch The Joker. Thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> You're welcome. Tells a side of the Joker no one has known <|endoftext|> That sounds wonderful. I accept that recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great. I hope you enjoy. <|endoftext|> ...The 'Accept' button seems to be absent. <|endoftext|> I think there needs to be 10 turn total <|endoftext|> I see, I thought we had met that minimum. Would you say that The Joker requires a lot of knowledge about the existing DC Comics universe to understand it? <|endoftext|> No it does not. This is a whole new storline <|endoftext|> Wonderful, I haven't been keeping up with it so that would've been a little concerning. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Would you like my help to recommend a movie? <|endoftext|> Hi I am wondering if you have seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> I have, I just saw Frozen 2. What about you? <|endoftext|> I have not see it yet, but I have heard some things about it. Did you like it? <|endoftext|> I did, the animation was great. The story was just okay though, have you seen any movies recently? <|endoftext|> I was wondering if the songs were good in Frozen? The last movie I saw was the Addams Family <|endoftext|> They were good, none of them were bad but I don't think any of them were that amazing. Oh, so you like animated movies? <|endoftext|> I do go to a lot of animated movies, mostly because that is what my kids pick, but I do like them. <|endoftext|> Well, Frozen 2 is definitely entertaining for the whole family, I think! How old are your kids? <|endoftext|> I have a 10 year old and a 5 year old, so I think they will love Frozen. I am sorry the songs were mediocre though! <|endoftext|> The songs weren't bad at all, I just don't think they can top Let it Go. Y'know? I think your kids are just the right age for Frozen 2 to come out though. <|endoftext|> I agree and it would be difficult to top Let it Go! Are there any new interesting characters? <|endoftext|> Quite a few actually! Though the bad news is your kids might ask for toys of some of them, there was this really cool water horse I remember. It was beautiful. <|endoftext|> Oh no! That is what I was afraid of! I have not gotten a chance to look at the Frozen 2 toys yet. <|endoftext|> Well theres probably quite a few, they add a lot of cute new little characters. There was also a salamander that's pretty cute, I did like the new characters in the movie. <|endoftext|> Well that is something to look forward to. I will probably take them on Monday since they have off school. I am sure I won't be the only one with that idea! <|endoftext|> Definitely not, plenty of kids in the theater for Frozen 2. Just hope they're well-behaved! The kids in my theater were very quiet, aside from laughing at Olaf. <|endoftext|> Yes, Olaf is a favorite character of mine and the kids. I was hoping he would be in Frozen 2! <|endoftext|> Of course he is! Kids love him after-all, I thought he was funny for the most-part. <|endoftext|> Well, thanks so much for the recommendation! I thought about taking the kids and now you have convinced me to go for it because I am curious about the new characters. Thanks again! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> hi, do you like movies? <|endoftext|> I do, I am into comedy and action the most. What about you? <|endoftext|> i really liked both Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody, but i also love comedies. which ones have you seen recently and can recommend? <|endoftext|> I recommend Long Shot with Seth Rogen. His role is different that his other movies so it was interesting watching him. It was a good movie that I would recommend. <|endoftext|> I don't know anything about this movie. Do you have any other suggestions? <|endoftext|> Good Boys is another good comedy. Same producers as Super bad. <|endoftext|> I don't know anything about this movie either. How about something more mainstream? Something that sold a lot of tickets? <|endoftext|> Toy Story 4 was a big hit and also very good. It will bring out your inner kid. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great idea. I love Tim Allen and Tom Hanks. I will go see Toy Story 4 this weekend. Thank you for this recommendation. <|endoftext|> Sure thing. I think you will enjoy it. <|endoftext|> You also said you like action movies. Does this mean you like James Bond? <|endoftext|> I am but only the older films like Live and Let Die <|endoftext|> So you don't like Daniel Craig? What about QUOTATION_MARKOn Her Majesties Secret Service?QUOTATION_MARK That is my favorite movie. But I also like QUOTATION_MARKGoldeneye.QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> No I do not think Daniel Craig was as good. I have never seen that  QUOTATION_MARKOn Her Majesties Secret Service?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Any others? Either Roger Moore or Sean Connery? <|endoftext|> Definitely Rodger Moore. <|endoftext|> Which other movies of his do you recommend? <|endoftext|> Moonraker is a good one. <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree with that choice, too. Maybe I can rent that one, too. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there. How are you today? I'm Steve and I'm here to help you find a trailer to watch. <|endoftext|> Hello Steve I am good thanks. How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great, thanks for asking. What's the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> Last movie I watch was Thor Ragnarok, even though I have seen it more than once, but I didn't have anything else to watch. I am looking for any action or scary movie to watch. Any suggestions? <|endoftext|> I'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe myself. There are a few good ones out there. Let's see if I can narrow it down a bit. Are there any actors that you particularly enjoy? And what style scary movie do you prefer? More along the lines of horror/slasher or tense thriller or something else? <|endoftext|> I am a big fan too, so I've seen all of them! I might be leaning more towards a scary movie. Last kind of scary movie I saw was Us. So I am more interested in a tense thriller. I don't like much the typical non sense slasher movie. <|endoftext|> Perfect. And are you looking for something that is in theaters now or a movie to watch at home? <|endoftext|> I am looking for something to watch at home. <|endoftext|> Okay. I have a few things in mind. One of my favorite thrillers is Copycat starring Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter. Sigourney Weaver stars as an agoraphobic forensic psychologist who studies serial killers and Holly Hunter is a detective looking for a killer who is copying some of the most famous serial killers of all time murder <|endoftext|> Oh es I have seen it is good. I am looking for something more recent though. More on the line of Hereditary, It, Us, Dr. Sleep... <|endoftext|> Okay. I understand. Let me see what else I can find for you that's newer. <|endoftext|> Great thanks! <|endoftext|> If you liked It, another good one based on Stephen King is Gerald's Game. It's the same guy who directed Dr. Sleep. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, I wanted to watch this one a while ago. I totally forgot about it. Thank you so much, I accept your recommendation!! <|endoftext|> Great. I'll send you the trailer to check out. Enjoy the movie and see it with someone you trust! <|endoftext|> Haha will do! Thank you! <|endoftext|> You're welcome. I'm based in Maine and if you aren't a Stephen King fan here, they don't let you stay. <|endoftext|> Haha I'll need to visit someday and get more recommendations! <|endoftext|> They call it Vacationland. It's actually a really beautiful state. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. But not now. It's 9degrees out. <|endoftext|> Oh wow its cold!! I'll wait for summer then!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi! I am really bored right now so can you recommend me a movie to watch? <|endoftext|> Are you a Disney or Super hero movie fan? <|endoftext|> I am a Disney movie fan <|endoftext|> The live action Lion King movie is better than what people gave it credit for <|endoftext|> I am not really a fan of the live action Disney remake movies <|endoftext|> Oh that's understandable. Maybe you're a fan of pixar then? <|endoftext|> I do like Pixar but I've seen all their movies, I would like something a bit different <|endoftext|> Hmm any genre in particular? <|endoftext|> I am looking for something that has romance <|endoftext|> Romance huh? Have you ever watched QUOTATION_MARKThe Silver liningQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> I have never heard of that. Is it a Disney movie? <|endoftext|> No. It's a romance movie. <|endoftext|> Oh, I was hoping for an animated Disney movie with romance in it <|endoftext|> Oh I don't mind providing suggestions about that. I don't know which ones you already seen though. <|endoftext|> I have seen all Disney movies from 2010 and onward, so any before that with romance would be great <|endoftext|> Hmm in that case, I feel like the Lady and the Tramp has a lot of romance. <|endoftext|> I've heard of that but I think that has romance between dogs. I was looking for something with romance between humans <|endoftext|> What about someone that was human? <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting! Please let me know what movie it is <|endoftext|> Beauty and the Beast <|endoftext|> Sounds fun! Thanks for the recommendation, I accept it and I will watch it right now! <|endoftext|> Thank you. I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Do you have a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> Sure, what kind of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> I enjoy romantic comedies, action, and children's movies. <|endoftext|> Pixar has a great selection of children's movies that also appeal to adults, are you familiar with Pixar? <|endoftext|> Yes, that is from Disney right? <|endoftext|> Disney owns them, but they do their own work. I highly recommend the movie Up. It's a heart warming journey with a little boy and his talking dog. They float their house with balloons and go on an adventure. <|endoftext|> Is that the one with the older man as well? <|endoftext|> Yes, very colorful and little sad at first but a fun journey. Would you prefer something less modern? <|endoftext|> No I think that would be great. I haven't watched it because it looked sad, but I think I'll give it a try. <|endoftext|> Hmm it seems that I can't recommend up at the moment, but here is a similar title called The BFG <|endoftext|> I have seen that movie before. Is there anything else you can recommend? <|endoftext|> Sure, going back to my animated recommendations Ratatouille is fantastic.

I went to the movie theater last night and saw Knives Out, it was awesome! Have you seen it yet, or been to the movies lately? I absolutely see why Knives Out was rated at around 97% rotten tomatoes. <|endoftext|> Hello, I am well thanks for asking. How are you? I can't say I have seen that movie or even heard of it. I am interested in a romance is there anything that you would recommend? <|endoftext|> Have you seen QUOTATION_MARKTo all the boys i still love youQUOTATION_MARK on netflix? Part 1 came out last year, and part 2 was recently released! It plays off the narrative of the first one and has some very interesting romances/flings/secret relationships... Plus it has some heart warming comedy. Do you like any other movie types? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't see that movie. What is it about? Who play in that movie? I love all kind of movies but more interested in a romance at the moment. <|endoftext|> the first one is actually called QUOTATION_MARKTo all the boys I've loved beforeQUOTATION_MARK and the second is called QUOTATION_MARKTo all the boys p.s. I still love youQUOTATION_MARK. I would recommend the second newer one, but since you haven't seen the first I would start by recommending that one. A high school girl writes letters to a bunch of her crushes. Unknowingly, they all get sent to every individual boy! The movie is all about her discovering relationships and having boys interested in her for the first time. She has to choose one of them though, who will it be? <|endoftext|> OH WOW! I know she was like OMG. I am curious on how the letters got out. I glad that never happened to me. I am also curious on who will it be as well. <|endoftext|> You should watch the movie so you can find out. It stars a handful of Netflix's new age of top actors and actresses like Lana Condor, Noah Centineo, and Janel Parrish. <|endoftext|> Okay awesome I will watch it thank you <|endoftext|> Great, so would you like to watch the trailer first? <|endoftext|> Yes, do you have the link? <|endoftext|> It's on netflix and youtube <|endoftext|> Okay. thanks going to watch it now :) <|endoftext|> where you able to find it? <|endoftext|> Okay, I will add this to the list. Do you recommend anything else? <|endoftext|> Yes, I selected QUOTATION_MARKMr. RightQUOTATION_MARK as well . It's another romantic comedy staring Sam Rockwell and Anna Hendrick. It;s about this crazy, goofy, funny, spy-like couple. A girl fall for the perfect guy, until it turns out hes not so perfect! He's actually a hitman on the run, who has a hit out on himself! I apologize, the first recommendation could not be searched and selected. <|endoftext|> That sound like a wild movie. Although I love Anna Kendrick movies. I watched all the pitch perfect movies. <|endoftext|> Great! She has a similar goofy comedic touch in this movie as well! It was also nominated for 2 awards. <|endoftext|> I want to see this one as well. So I am going to add both movies to my list. Now I have a couple of movies to watch for the day. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the trailer for Mr. Right? <|endoftext|> I watched it and I am sold on the movie. Although I was sold when I knew Anna Kendrick was in it. I am a big fan. Thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> Hello I was wondering if you had a good recommendation for a sci-fi or action movie? <|endoftext|> I am not really into sci-fi movies but do you like superhero movies? If you do the avengers is a great movie <|endoftext|> Yes Iike superhero movies! However, I have seen the Avengers. Do you know of any others? <|endoftext|> Thor, Ant Man, Spider man, Black Panther, Hulk, Batman those are all great movies <|endoftext|> Neat! I would love to learn more about the Black Panther. I have heard of it, but I haven't seen it yet! <|endoftext|> The black panther is a great movie about African tribes fighting over meterorite I think you will really enjoy it if you like action and super her movies <|endoftext|> Fascinating! I bet that has some great suspense for a superhero movie as well. I am going to plan on seeing that movie in the future! Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> you are very welcome I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did <|endoftext|> Thanks! Is it one of your top 5 favorite super-hero movies? <|endoftext|> yes it is! <|endoftext|> Great! I'll also have to see Hulk, which was on your list as well. <|endoftext|> That is another great movie <|endoftext|> Awesome! What do you plan on seeing next? <|endoftext|> well I am taking my niece to see the new frozen movie tomorrow <|endoftext|> Neat! Do you like cartoons as much as superhero movies? <|endoftext|> yes I enjoy a good cartoon movie every now and then <|endoftext|> Awesome. Have you seen Toy Story 4? I love the character Forky. <|endoftext|> no I have not seen that movie yet. I have heard good things about it. Is it worth seeing? <|endoftext|> Yes! It is really good, but not as good as the first two Toy Story movies. <|endoftext|> I will have to check that out. Maybe I will watch it with my niece this week <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> ok high <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you'd like to see? <|endoftext|> no clear idea <|endoftext|> Tell me about some movies you've seen before and really liked. <|endoftext|> parasite korean movie it was good <|endoftext|> Great! That's a pretty intense thriller. Do you want a similar movie trailer to watch? <|endoftext|> yes if possible <|endoftext|> Okay. Have you ever seen any of Bong Joon Ho's other movies? <|endoftext|> some of them <|endoftext|> Tell me more about what you really liked about Parasite. <|endoftext|> the flow of the story <|endoftext|> So you like how the story unfolds? <|endoftext|> unexpected events in the middle of the movie <|endoftext|> All right. I have a kind of off-beat movie to recommend. It has some strange and unexpected turns. I read the book first and I had trouble putting it down. It's called The Family Fang with Jason Bateman, Nicole Kidman, and Christpher Walken. <|endoftext|> ok sounds great <|endoftext|> That's great. I think you'll love it. <|endoftext|> thank you! <|endoftext|> It's one of those great movies you can't believe you hadn't heard of before. <|endoftext|> Got it thank you for recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. How is everything today? <|endoftext|> Everything is going well, thanks! How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great today. Thanks <|endoftext|> That is wonderful. I think it's a perfect day to see a good movie. <|endoftext|> What genre of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I really enjoy movies with clever comedy (as opposed to cheap comedy), dramas, documentaries, and movies that make you think. <|endoftext|> Do you have a favorite actor for this types of movies? <|endoftext|> Kate Winslet is a personal favorite. I also love Meryl Streep. <|endoftext|> I have a movie that I think you will like its called Divergent. <|endoftext|> Oh that sounds very interesting. I'd love to hear more. <|endoftext|> Its a movie in a futuristic world were Kate Winslet's character must decide which faction she wants to join in order to survive. <|endoftext|> I do believe that would be a fascinating watch! <|endoftext|> Yes it is. I highly recommend!! <|endoftext|> I would love to see it. I love to watch Kate Winslet - she is such a talent! <|endoftext|> She is awesome. I will get that trailer for you if you want. <|endoftext|> Yes, please! Thanks so much for your thoughtful recommendation. <|endoftext|> You're very welcome!! It was nice chatting with you today. <|endoftext|> Likewise! It was my pleasure. <|endoftext|> You have a wonderful day!!! <|endoftext|> I hope you do as well. Can't wait to learn more about this exciting film. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! <|endoftext|> Hi friend! <|endoftext|> Tell me, what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Cheeky Comedy movies tend to be my favorite right now. Family movies such as Disney are always lovable. Funny you ask, I am actually looking for a recommendation. <|endoftext|> Glad to hear! You should check out Shazam! It's very funny and fun and if you're a Disney fan definitely watch Toy Story 4. <|endoftext|> Shazam was an awesome movie I must say. I would watch it again however i must accept your second recommendation of Toy Story 4. Those were amazing movies and I specifically like the first one the most. Although that is my stance, it may soon change after watching the 4th one. In my best Woody voice: QUOTATION_MARKThanks partnerQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Also check out the comedy classic Groundhog Day, Bill Murray is great in it. Also, if the kids are pokemon fans give Detective Pikachu a chance. <|endoftext|> Bill Murray is a very famous actor and has been in quite a few movies now. He is easily one of the greatest to do it. I have heard of Groundhog Day and maybe seen it before but wouldn't hurt to check it out. I have heard great things about that new movie detective Pikachu, I believe it has Ryan Reynolds as the main character of course other than Pikachu. Fun movie think that came out this year? <|endoftext|> Definitely check out Jojo Rabbit, it was written and directed by the director of Thor Ragnarok, Taika Waititi. You can also check out Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. <|endoftext|> Got it. I will add all of these amazing suggestions to my list, thank you so much! I am so excited to review some of these movie trailers, I gotta go check them out right now! Thanks again bud! <|endoftext|> No problem, I'm glad that I was able to give you a few recommendations! <|endoftext|> ya nws bro ggs I actually pulled up that pikachu trailer on my phone, it was funny <|endoftext|> Nice! Good to hear that you liked it! <|endoftext|> I liked the animation they did on pikachu it was pretty unique. I remember when Avatar came out and those graphics where mind blowing <|endoftext|> Be sure to check out Tron: Legacy, it's good for kids and it has high quality graphics that are mind blowing. <|endoftext|> Truth tron was cray man <|endoftext|> And also check out Mad Max: Fury Road, one of the best movies of the decade. <|endoftext|> Mad Max huh? Sounds pretty cool Fury road makes it sound like an action movie with cars maybe? lol..Action movies definitely reserve their spot in the top. <|endoftext|> Yes, non stop action with cars and loud music and effects that are out of this world. <|endoftext|> Well thanks for the recommendations, nothing beats seeing a movie that's in theatre <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm good! I'm actually looking for a movie recommendation, do you have any? <|endoftext|> I just might. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> The only movies I don't like are horror movies and really slow ones. I like movies with a good, intricate plot <|endoftext|> What is your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Either action or comedy <|endoftext|> I love comedy. Do you have any favorite actors? <|endoftext|> Not really! Do you? <|endoftext|> I like Andy Sandberg. He's hilarious. Do you like more raunchy comedies or tasteful comedies? <|endoftext|> I like Andy Sandberg too! But generally I like romantic comedies more so than raunchy. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Have you seen The other woman? <|endoftext|> I have not! What's that about <|endoftext|> It's about a woman who's husband has an affair and the mistress and wife become best friends and get back at him. its a great movie. it has Cameron Diaz in it <|endoftext|> Oh I think I've heard of that! Thank you, I'll think I'll watch that tonight <|endoftext|> Great! it was nice talking to you! <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|> well I guess I have a few more questions before you go <|endoftext|> I have one for you, have you seen The Other Woman before? <|endoftext|> Yes I have <|endoftext|> Oh great! Then I trust your recommendation. Have a nice evening! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey! <|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> How are you doing? <|endoftext|> I am great, i am actually looking for a movie recommendation <|endoftext|> Cool! I just got done watching John Wick 3 gotta love Keanu Reeves.

Make sure you have lots of snacks <|endoftext|> cant forget it ! hahaha <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi! Thank you for being willing to help. I am excited to see the movie trailer. <|endoftext|> What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> A movie called QUOTATION_MARKPrimer.QUOTATION_MARK It's an independent film about two engineers that discover time travel and it ends up causing them serious problems. <|endoftext|> Sounds cool, do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> It was great. It was sort of confusing trying to keep all the timelines straight, but I enjoyed it. I like all sorts of movies and genres. I do really enjoy time travel though (love Back to the Future and Terminator). My favorite genre is probably psychological thrillers. <|endoftext|> Got it, I will try to find a recommendation. <|endoftext|> I just really like movies in general. Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, Horror, Sci-Fi. Oddly though, I don't really get into Comic Book movies. I didn't grow up with comics, so I think I missed out on something, but I just don't get excited about all the Marvel movies and stuff. <|endoftext|> I don't like comic book movies either. <|endoftext|> Mad respect for you. What's your favorite movie? <|endoftext|> Back to the Future Part 1 <|endoftext|> That's an awesome movie! <|endoftext|> I recommend the movie No Country for Old Men. I think you will like the movie. <|endoftext|> Sure. I would watch the trailer for that. <|endoftext|> Hope you like the movie <|endoftext|> Thanks! As I said, I just generally enjoy most movies, so I'm willing to give anything a try really. Thanks for the recommendation. I am eager for you to send me the trailer. <|endoftext|> I selected the trailer for you. <|endoftext|> Thank you. Nice chatting with you. Have a good day! <|endoftext|> Thanks you too <|endoftext|> If you like Time Travel, I recommend Primer to you. But it might take a couple viewings to really get it. Luckily, it's relatively short. <|endoftext|> Thanks, did you like the trailer I sent you? <|endoftext|> It looks very interesting. I think I'll watch the whole movie. I usually like Tommy Lee Jones. And I really liked Javier Bardem in Skyfall. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you find a movie to watch! <|endoftext|> Great, I love movies. Anything you can recommend? I've been watching a lot of science fiction movies recently. <|endoftext|> Well, my absolute favorite movie of all time is Interstellar, and it's pretty science fiction(y)-- have you ever seen it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I have seen it. Great movie, Matthew McConaughey is a good actor. So was Anne Hathaway. <|endoftext|> I completely agree-- the entire movie just blew my mind because it's science fiction but it's honestly something that actually could happen one day. But if you've already seen that, then let's focus on finding you something new! What's the last movie you watched and what did you like or not like about it? <|endoftext|> I recently watched the 1st avengers movie, I especially liked the Incredible Hulk. Reminds me of my childhood. <|endoftext|> Ah, the Avengers movies are so good! I personally adore the Avengers Universe and I think my favorite movie so far has been Spiderman Homecoming with Tom Holland as Spiderman. Have you seen that movie? <|endoftext|> No I haven't, the last Spiderman I watched were the ones with Toby McGuire. <|endoftext|> I watched the ones with Toby McGuire when I was younger, and those are amazing too. But I actually really love what they have done with the new version of Spiderman. In Spiderman Homecoming, Peter Parker is kind of like a geeky, weak high-school student who doesn't have a lot going for him until he becomes Spiderman! It's a refreshing twist on Spiderman in my opinion; it's a retelling, not a replacement for Toby McGuire's famous Spiderman! <|endoftext|> Perhaps I should watch the newer ones. Right now I'm wondering why Spiderman wasn't included in the avengers, wasn't he also a Stan Lee creation? <|endoftext|> He was-- Spiderman actually shows up in the third Avenger Movie, Avengers: Infinity War. I think he was an addition that they hadn't thought of before, so they introduced him first in Captain America: Civil War before he was actually in Spiderman: Homecoming. But yes, he is introduced in the third Avengers movie and then he is in all of the subsequent Avenger's movies! <|endoftext|> I plan to watch the rest of the avengers movies, it'll be interesting to see how Spiderman affects the movie. I also watched Captain Marvel the other day, I enjoyed the performance by Brie Larson, and Samuel Jackson is always good. <|endoftext|> Then I think my final recomendation will actually be Avengers: Age of Ultron. I know you like science fiction and the Avengers, so I feel like this is logically the next best movie for you to watch! Spiderman isn't in this movie, but he appears in the next one; however, you have to watch the Avengers movies in order to understand what's going on in them. So what do you think? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I'll take you up on the recommendation to watch Age of Ultron. Did you notice they are also making a movie about Black Widow? I enjoyed that character from The Avengers <|endoftext|> I did! Doesn't Scarlette Johanson star as Black Widow? I don't know a lot about her storyline, but she is definitely amazing in her role as Black Widow! She appears in the subsequent Avenger's movies as well, so you should enjoy her in those. <|endoftext|> Yes, Scarlett Johansson. I remember seeing her in a movie called The Horse Whisperer, it was a sad movie. But Scarlett Johansson gave a nice performance. It may have been one of her 1st movies. <|endoftext|> I actually just <|endoftext|> I'm trying to think of what else she has appeared in, all I can think of is The Island <|endoftext|> I just saw Jojo Rabbit in theaters and she stars as the mother of Jojo. The story takes place in Nazi Germany during World War II and she is great in her role as the mother of the boy. If you ever have time, Jojo Rabbit is still in theaters and it's a must see! <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of Jojo Rabbit, is a drama? War movie? <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's a comedy movie about a little boy in Nazi Germany who has Hitler as an imaginary friend. After he finds out that his mom is hiding a Jewish girl in their house, he slowly changes his ideologies to fit less with Hitler's. It's a great movie and I'd highly recommend. But yes, it was great talking with you! I hope that you have a great time watching the next Avenger's movies, but firstly, Avengers: Age of Ultron! <|endoftext|> Okay, thank you for the recommendation. Looking forward to seeing the trailer <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi There! How is everything this evening? <|endoftext|> It's going well! How about you? <|endoftext|> Great! So are you thinking of making it a movie-night tonight? <|endoftext|> I am definitely thinking about it. If not tonight, sometime this extended holiday weekend. <|endoftext|> Awesome! There are some great movies right now that I'm really excited about. What movie are you thinking about this holiday weekend? <|endoftext|> I have really been into thrillers and horrors lately. <|endoftext|> Oh really?! What have you watched lately? <|endoftext|> I will admit I watch a lot of B level type horrors, but I did watch QUOTATION_MARKHereditaryQUOTATION_MARK recently. <|endoftext|> Cool! Oh my goodness have you seen the trailer for QUOTATION_MARKKnives OutQUOTATION_MARK? You should definitely check it out...it has that murder-mystery vibe down and just seems really interesting. What do you think? <|endoftext|> Sounds a little like the movie Clue. Are there a lot of acrots I might recognize in it? <|endoftext|> It has Daniel Craig and Katherine Langford! The reviews are fabulous on Rotten Tomatoes... <|endoftext|> Sounds really interesting. I think I would like to check it out. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, definitely. <|endoftext|> ok let me see if I can find it for you <|endoftext|> You mentioned the reviews. What ratings does it have overall? <|endoftext|> 7.6/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 99%, Metacritic: 84/100 <|endoftext|> That sounds great. I definitely want to check this out. <|endoftext|> Ok I'm going to see what I can find for you <|endoftext|> Sounds great. Thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi , what can I help you look for today? <|endoftext|> I'm looking for a movie trailer. I'm looking for something that would be fun to watch, preferably a comedy. <|endoftext|> what kind of comedy do you enjoy? romcom, horror comedy, etc? <|endoftext|> horror comedies are great! I really like Edgar Wright's Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. I'm not much into rom-coms. I also really love Will Ferrell movies. <|endoftext|> will farrell is hillarious!! have you seen step brothers? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I love that movie! Anchorman is also great. <|endoftext|> Yes I loved the anchorman!! <|endoftext|> Are there any trailers for movies as funny as those movies? I also really like Eddie Murphy,  and Melissa McCarthy. <|endoftext|> got it! <|endoftext|> Yeah? What do you recommend? <|endoftext|> happytime murders starring melissa McCarthy <|endoftext|> I've not seen that one. I'll have to check it out. <|endoftext|> Its hillarious!! my husband and I couldn't stop laughing <|endoftext|> perfect! That is what I am looking for. Thank you! <|endoftext|> your very welcome. have a great night <|endoftext|> Thank you! You too. <|endoftext|> also enjoy the movie <|endoftext|> Are there any other movies with Melissa McCarthy in them that are also good? I really liked her in Spy and Bridesmaids. <|endoftext|> life of the party is also another awesome one thats hillarious! <|endoftext|> I forgot about that movie. I'll have to watch that one too. <|endoftext|> happytime murders <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> What's a good comedy? <|endoftext|> I'm not that familiar with comedies, but I've heard that Booksmart is a good one. Would you like to know more about it? <|endoftext|> Sure, what's Booksmart about? <|endoftext|> It's about two overachieving high school girls who decide to cram all the things they missed out on in high school into one night. <|endoftext|> Whose it starring? This almost feels like a Melissa McCarthy role. <|endoftext|> It's got Lisa Kudrow from friends! No Melissa McCarthy though, surprisingly. <|endoftext|> Ooh, I like Lisa Kudrow. Haven't seen in her a movie yet. <|endoftext|> Me neither! I think I need to watch this movie ASAP. Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes. Sounds good. I'd like to see who she's starring along too. <|endoftext|> Okay! I will show it to you when we're done chatting. It has a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes! <|endoftext|> Oh! That's pretty high. Is it a holiday movie too? <|endoftext|> Nope! Oh, and it has Carrie Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd from American Horror Story. <|endoftext|> Oh good. I haven't seen AHS, but I've heard good things about it. <|endoftext|> I love it. I recommend the Freak Show season. <|endoftext|> Tbh I wasn't crazy about The Walking Dead, but I'm all in for that show now. Is it similar? <|endoftext|> I would say not really, but I do like them both. <|endoftext|> I was also thinking about catching Jojo Rabbit. Any thoughts? <|endoftext|> I've never heard of it but I just looked it up and it looks really interesting! <|endoftext|> It has a Wes Andersen vibe, and he does some really great work, more a weird comedy troupe though. Thanks for the rec! I'll check out Booksmart first. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good Afternoon, what was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw was Joker. <|endoftext|> Did you like it? <|endoftext|> I did. <|endoftext|> What types of movies do you like <|endoftext|> I like thrillers, comedy, and sci-fi <|endoftext|> Got It <|endoftext|> I don't like romantic comedy though. <|endoftext|> I think you would like the movie White Chicks because it is a comedic twist of an undercover cop movie trying to catch a mischievous person. It's one of my favorite movies <|endoftext|> I have seen it. It is very goofy. I like movies with a better plot line. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Roll Bounce? <|endoftext|> No, what is it about? <|endoftext|> Roll Bounce is about a group of friends who love to go roller skating, but there local roller rink is shutting down. They go to a new skating rink that is on the richer side of town. In order to gain the rich people's respect they have to prove themselves in a skate off. It's a nice family comedy movie that recreates the 80's <|endoftext|> It sounds interesting. I would like to see the trailer! <|endoftext|> Awesome! Hope you enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Do you have any questions about the movie? <|endoftext|> What actors are in tis? <|endoftext|> Shad Moss (Bow Wow), Chi McBride, Meagan Good, Nick Cannon <|endoftext|> Oh, yeah.

I Definitely recommend it! <|endoftext|> I'll look it up <|endoftext|> What do you have to recommend to me? <|endoftext|> I would recommend QUOTATION_MARKA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.QUOTATION_MARK You'll be so happy afterward. <|endoftext|> Sure.

I would definitely be interested in watching it! <|endoftext|> Great and Thank you!- <|endoftext|> Thank you as well. <|endoftext|> Okay, I think that should do it for this chat. <|endoftext|> Yes I agree! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, do you like watching movies? <|endoftext|> I love watching all kinds of movies, how about you? <|endoftext|> I do. I like comedies and action. What do you like? <|endoftext|> I like horror and action especially. <|endoftext|> Did you see Us? <|endoftext|> I haven't, did you? Was it good? <|endoftext|> It was great. Kind of reminded me of The Ring. Did you see that one? <|endoftext|> I did. It sounds a bit like either The Strangers or The Crazies? to me, can't remember which one. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen those yet, but I'm pretty excited to see The New Mutants <|endoftext|> That one does sound like its going to be maybe the first decent x-men movie in a while lol <|endoftext|> That's true. So you've seen the trailer? Would you watch it again? <|endoftext|> I'd watch the trailer again, sure! <|endoftext|> I've seen it a few times and can't really figure out if it's supposed to be straight up horror or just an improved X Men movie. Know what I mean? <|endoftext|> yeah, its like they don't really know what they're doing yet but it's classed as horror so I guess both maybe? <|endoftext|> Yes, with lots of QUOTATION_MARKshocksQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKjump scaresQUOTATION_MARK - like The Conjuring, I guess. Did you see that? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed that one, but I think maybe only because of the company I was in. Still, I enjoy the series and the Annabelle ones too. Did you see The Nun? <|endoftext|> No way I saw the Nun! Too scary! lol I'm still haunted by Pan's Labyrinth. <|endoftext|> It's alright you didn't miss anything good. But Pan's Labyrinth was amazing. <|endoftext|> Definitely had action and horror! That seems to be common in lots of movies. <|endoftext|> yeah! Have you got an idea for me?:) <|endoftext|> I do!

Have you seen Terminator:Dark Fate? <|endoftext|> No, but I've heard some good things about it. <|endoftext|> It is a good one.

I have seen several movies lately that I would recommend. <|endoftext|> I love movies and would love to hear your recommendations. <|endoftext|> If you like mystery/whodunit movies, I would recommend Knives Out. It has a great cast, twist and turns, and a bit of dark comedy. <|endoftext|> I did see Knives Out and I definitely enjoyed it. I do enjoy a mystery. I also enjoy horror, drama, and comedy. I watcha  lot of movies but some have certainly fallen through the cracks for me. <|endoftext|> Glad you enjoyed it too. Wow, so you appreciate many genres! Another movie I loved was Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler. it is quite a departure from what you are used to seeing from Sandler. I also didn't see the ending coming from a mile away which I really appreciate. <|endoftext|> I am aware of that one but have not seen it. I have been meaning to but the director's last movie Good Time was also well received and I hated it so I have been unsure. <|endoftext|> I would tell you to give it a shot. Sandler is really good in it and I think he got robbed by not getting nominated for an Oscar. The supporting characters are great as well, and Kevin Durant's role is not just a cameo, he is integral part of the story. Definitely recommend it. <|endoftext|> I am curious. Good Time was suspenseful but I found myself very bored. Did you feel that way at all about Uncut Gems? What kind of tone did you get from it? <|endoftext|> Not at all. It is dark for sure. It moves pretty fast, and Sandler is constantly going. It kind of made me nervous/anxious at times because some scenes are chaotic, but that is part of the narrative. I saw it with my family, husband and two early-twenties boys and we all really like it. <|endoftext|> Good to know. That makes me more interested. Did you know who any of the other actors were because he is the only one I have heard anything about? <|endoftext|> Yes. Indina Manzel (sp?) is his wife and Judd Hirsh is his father-in-law. The other actors are people who I have seen in other things, but don't know them by name but you will recognize them. <|endoftext|> I am familiar with them. Judd Hirsh is a very good actor. <|endoftext|> Absolutely....all the way back to his Taxi days! Yes, I am that old! <|endoftext|> Ha ha. I'm somewhere in between. I saw it when I was very, very young. <|endoftext|> Well i hope you take me up on my recommendation and see Uncut Gems, if only to see Sandler's amazing performance. <|endoftext|> You have convinced me. I would like to see it now and am sure I will soon. <|endoftext|> Great! Enjoy the rest of your day! <|endoftext|> Thank you. I would definitely like to see the trailer for Uncut Gems. <|endoftext|> I will send you the trailer. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did! <|endoftext|> Thank you. I am sure I will. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! I'm Jessica, I will help you find a great movie to watch now. How are you today? <|endoftext|> Yes <|endoftext|> How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Good, looking for a good drama to watch <|endoftext|> What was the last drama movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> It was Lighthouse <|endoftext|> Oh I really liked Robert Pattinson in that movie! It was a very different role for him. <|endoftext|> It was, have a recommendation for another good drama? <|endoftext|> I most certainly do! I have a couple of other questions first before I recommend. What did you like the most about the movie, The Lighthouse? <|endoftext|> I liked the suspense <|endoftext|> Perfect! I think based on your fondness of drama and suspense, you would greatly enjoy Marriage Story. It stars Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. It's a dramatic look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. Lots of drama, suspense and love. <|endoftext|> Sounds good, I will watch that, thank you <|endoftext|> Awesome, I really think you will it enjoy it like I did! <|endoftext|> I like Adam driver too <|endoftext|> Oh me too! Did you ever watch him in the show, Girls? He was recently on SNL too and he was hilarious. <|endoftext|> Ha, no, sounds funny though <|endoftext|> You should check out his SNL episode too. It aired just a few weeks ago. He made a lot of great jokes in his own style haha <|endoftext|> I will look that up! <|endoftext|> Amazing! Drama and comedy and great together. <|endoftext|> Great combo thanks again <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there <|endoftext|> hi how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well thank you. I was just finishing up watching a movie. Do you enjoy movies? <|endoftext|> i sure do what did you watch? im looking for new movie choices <|endoftext|> I was just finishing up the old Poltergeist film from the 1980s. It's one of my favorites.What types of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> thats a good one, i like all kinds of movies ! you name it id give it a shot! <|endoftext|> What was the latest movie you watched that you enjoyed? Maybe I can recommend something from that genre. <|endoftext|> last one i watched was venom on starz i know its been out awhile but i just got a chance to watch it <|endoftext|> Ah, that's a pretty decent one. If you liked that movie, i'd recommend a movie called Upgrade that came out in 2018.It's got somewhat of a similar QUOTATION_MARKruined man finding his life improved by an implantQUOTATION_MARK type theme to it. <|endoftext|> that sounds interesting ill deff check that one out! <|endoftext|> Awesome! I highly recommend it. You have a great night! <|endoftext|> you as well! <|endoftext|> Actually, as we seem to have a few more minutes, I also recommend Fight Club. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> thats a classic one of my favorites actially! whats your favorite movie wonder if ive seen it? <|endoftext|> Hmm let's see. One of my favorites is actually an early 1980s movie called Sleep Away Camp. Have you heard of it? It's kind of so bad that it's good. <|endoftext|> no i havent ill have to check it out! any other movies you recommend? <|endoftext|> Let's see..the sequels to Sleep Away Camp are pretty bad but good also. If you know what I mean. That cheesey horror type deal. Oh! inner space starring a young Dennis Quad is amazing! I highly recommend it. <|endoftext|> i like dennis quaid just watched one rec were he sold corn seeds and farmed them too good movie cant rem the name <|endoftext|> That's awesome. Well, I think it's time to go. Have a great night! enjoy your movies <|endoftext|> absolutly you too hopefully we have completed enough responces to be enough think is said 10 or so <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello How are you doing? What kind of movie do you like? <|endoftext|> Hi, I'm good. I typically like to watch comedies <|endoftext|> I see. Have you heard of or seen the Hangover series? It's pretty cool! <|endoftext|> What's it about? <|endoftext|> The first Hangover film is the funniest. A group of guys throw a bachelor party at Vegas, forget everything and the groom ends up missing. What do you think? <|endoftext|> Oh that sounds cool! I'll definitely look into it, thank you! <|endoftext|> Sure thing. Do you like only comedies? Do you like dark humor too? <|endoftext|> I pretty much only like comedies, but I can't wait to watch the Hangover series now! <|endoftext|> Okay then! Enjoy! It was nice talking to you <|endoftext|> Nice talking to you too :) <|endoftext|> Oops. I think we should discuss more movies. I am trying to show you the trailer. Would you be interested in Hangover III? <|endoftext|> Definitely! What's the plot of that one about? <|endoftext|> Pretty much the same thing as the first one except that some new faces join the cast <|endoftext|> Oh cool! Who are the main actors? <|endoftext|> Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis. I think Galifianakis is the funniest. <|endoftext|> Isn't there a guy that used to be a doctor in the movie? <|endoftext|> Ha.. Yeah they made fun of him insisting to be called a doctor when he is only a dentist. He is in Hangover III too <|endoftext|> Haha that's funny. I'm really excited to watch this series now <|endoftext|> Yes definitely check the trailer out and rent it on Amazon or Netflix. You will like it! <|endoftext|> Ok thank you so much for the recommendation :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi. I'm looking for a current movie that's character-driven, not having a gimmicky plot. <|endoftext|> Do you have a favorite actor or actress in mind? <|endoftext|> Meryl Streep, but I don't know if she has  a current film. <|endoftext|> Have you seen her in the movie Mamma Mia? She does such a great job in that movie! <|endoftext|> Yes, I loved that, and I'd love to see it again. Thanks! <|endoftext|> She is also fantastic in The River Wild, by far my favorite movie of hers. <|endoftext|> Yes, I've seen that too. Such a different role for her. <|endoftext|> It was a very strong role, even back then for a women, and she did such a great job with that one. <|endoftext|> You becomes the character in each of her films, and each character is different. Did you see her as Julia Child in QUOTATION_MARKJulie and Julia?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I have not, but now I really want to! <|endoftext|> I'm heading to the library tomorrow to get QUOTATION_MARKMamma Mia!QUOTATION_MARK They don't charge for DVD's, and I can keep them 3 weeks. <|endoftext|> That is a great idea! I may have to take your advice and do that also :) <|endoftext|> We havec 39 libraries in the county, and they're all in one system. <|endoftext|> Wow! I don't remember the last time I was in  library, they change so much over the years <|endoftext|> I liked Peirce Brosnanin QUOTATION_MARKMamma Mia!QUOTATION_MARK He looked totally lost and confused. And he even sang. He was a hoot! <|endoftext|> Now I want to see the trailer for the movie, really get me into the mood to watch it <|endoftext|> I don't know where you would find a trailer of a 10-year-old film, do you? <|endoftext|> Do you want to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure, if you find one, email me the URL. And QUOTATION_MARKThe River WildQUOTATION_MARK is more than acceptable too. Bye. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there. What kind of moives do you like? <|endoftext|> Most type of movies. Well not war movies or sports as much! A good comedy or love story sign me up! <|endoftext|> Oh nice. So, what is your favorite comedy or love story? <|endoftext|> One that keeps popping into mind is Central Intelligence! The Rock and Kevin Hart are my favorite! <|endoftext|> Ok, so super goofy comedy. Do you like <|endoftext|> Well if I laugh a lot it is a winner. I do not like immature humor though. What about you? What do you like in movies? <|endoftext|> Sorry, I totally pressed the wrong button there. I was going to ask if you like SNL character type comedies.I do like movies. I see what you are saying. Not Bevis and Butthead. lol <|endoftext|> Exactly! I do like SNL most of the time. I think it has gotten a bit boring. I enjoyed it more in my high school and college days. Do you like comedy or do you like the war movies haha? <|endoftext|> I like most movies. If you like romantic comedies, I would like to throw out some of my favorites and see if you have seen them yet or not. <|endoftext|> Sounds good to me! <|endoftext|> Stranger than Fiction, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Pleasentville.They are good and mind bending, which I love. <|endoftext|> Oh mind bending is great. I have seen Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I actually have that movie pop into my head occasionally. I definitely am going to put that on my to watch again list. I have not seen the other two... <|endoftext|> Ok, Stranger than Fiction stars Will Ferrell. Short plot peek: An I.R.S. auditor suddenly finds himself the subject of narration only he can hear: narration that begins to affect his entire life, from his work, to his love-interest, to his death. <|endoftext|> Interesting. Tell me about the other one! <|endoftext|> It Stars Toby McGuire. He is in QUOTATION_MARKtodayQUOTATION_MARK and falls asleep or something and wakes up in the tv program he adores. He is dressed in 50's clothing and is in black and white. He helps the close minded people in this era see how things could really be if they just opened up. <|endoftext|> Wait! I have seen that one! I am definitely taking your recommendations on Stranger than Fiction and rewatching Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind! <|endoftext|> Thank you. I know the Stranger one sounds less exciting, but I like Will Ferrell in this one a bunch because it is unlike any of his other rolls. Just like Jim Cary in Eternal Sunshine. It is cool to see him in this different but still funny way. Do you think you would be interested in seeing the trailer? <|endoftext|> I would thanks! <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it. It was a pleasure to work with you. <|endoftext|> You too thanks so much! do happen to have the trailer for the Jim Carey one? its been a long long time since I've seen that one! <|endoftext|> Oh yes, you can find anyting on youtube. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there! How are you? <|endoftext|> hi I am fine and you? <|endoftext|> I'm well! I came to talk to you about your favorite movies. Do you have any? <|endoftext|> yes I do. Star Trek, adventure movies and comedies especially. <|endoftext|> And so would you say your favorite genre is more action or sci-fi? <|endoftext|> today it is more sci-fi on my mind. <|endoftext|> Sci-Fi is great! And have you seen nay of those genre movies in the theaters lately? <|endoftext|> no last movie I saw was and an adventure one about cars. Isn't there a new one about space? <|endoftext|> There are a few new ones about space. I am about to find some good movies in this genre for you that have been nominated. <|endoftext|> Has one been nominated for best picture? <|endoftext|> Yes, After Earth has been highly acclaimed. It is a space and sci fi movie you would love. Have you heard of it? <|endoftext|> Yes and it sounds interesting. I think you have found a movie I can get into with interest. Thank you. <|endoftext|> Of course. I would also recommend Avengers: Endgame. This one came out last year and has been highly acclaimed by the public as a great action and sci-fi film. <|endoftext|> I think the new one as I have already seen Avengers: Endgame. Thank you anyway. <|endoftext|> Oh, I see! Yes, and another is Sharktopus, which is a grueling sci-fi film. <|endoftext|> Sounds rather gruesome with that combination of name! Not my type. Do you have any more information on After Earth, actors in it for instance. <|endoftext|> It has Will Smith, Jaden Smith and Zoe Kravitz! <|endoftext|> hmmm, They sound like good actors! Is this a post Apocalyptic type movie? I have forgotten the plot. <|endoftext|> It is about people who were forced to leave Earth a millennium ago to establish a new home on Nova Prime. It is very much a new-age science finction film set in space! It has been highly acclaimed. I think you will likely love it. <|endoftext|> I think so too. Thank you so much. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> hi there <|endoftext|> So what movies have you seen lately? <|endoftext|> I've last seen the Irishman and Once upon a time in Hollywood. <|endoftext|> Are those your favorite type of movies? <|endoftext|> I usually prefer action movies <|endoftext|> Is there an actor you like best? <|endoftext|> I would probably have to say Denzel Washington <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Equalizer? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. <|endoftext|> would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would. <|endoftext|> ok. there is also a sequel. <|endoftext|> That's perfect I would probably enjoy them both. <|endoftext|> It is a little older of a movie, but a good one. <|endoftext|> I don't mind that. Sometimes older movies are better. <|endoftext|> Okay I will let you watch the trailer <|endoftext|> Thank you. <|endoftext|> you are welcome! <|endoftext|> Look's very intriguing, maybe you could offer me more suggestions. <|endoftext|> there is another <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hello how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm good how are you <|endoftext|> good Im looking for a good action any movies see any lately <|endoftext|> I haven't seen any action movies lately, but I heard some of the marvel movies are good. Have you seen Captain Marvel? I heard it's good <|endoftext|> i have is is very good movie marvel movies are good . Are there any new ones out sents endgame <|endoftext|> As for Avenger movies, there haven't been any new ones lately, but for marvel movies, I've heard that Captain Marvel, Spiderman Far from Home, and Dark Phoenix were all good <|endoftext|> spiderman far from home was good what was your favorite part? <|endoftext|> My favorite part was when Parker defeated beck, how about you? <|endoftext|> same ... I think ill take your recomendation and watch dark phonix is it good as well? <|endoftext|> Yes I have heard it's good! <|endoftext|> Have a good evening <|endoftext|> You too <|endoftext|> any more good movies you can thank of ? <|endoftext|> Captain Marvel is also pretty good, especially since you like action movies. I've recommended the Dark Phoenix trailer for you to watch. <|endoftext|> i will watch it thank you <|endoftext|> Sounds good! <|endoftext|> have you seen the men in black movies? <|endoftext|> No, unfortuntaely I haven't seen most of them <|endoftext|> you sould watch the trailer for the newest men in black it is realy good and has the actor that plays Thor in it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. Nice to be talking to you. <|endoftext|> Hi there! I am looking for a good romance movie. Do you have any ideas? <|endoftext|> Well, I guess there are a lot of choices. Do you like new and edgy romance or classic romance films? <|endoftext|> I guess I like both. Some of my favorites are QUOTATION_MARKNights in RodentheQUOTATION_MARK, QUOTATION_MARKThe Time Traveler's WifeQUOTATION_MARK, QUOTATION_MARKMaid of HonorQUOTATION_MARK, and QUOTATION_MARKWedding DateQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Hmmm. Okay then. Also do you like films with big stars in them? <|endoftext|> I do, but I also like movies with relatively unknown actors as well. <|endoftext|> Fair enough. Well I'm still trying to get an idea of what your taste in movies is like. What struck you as good or interesting in The Time Traveler's Wife? <|endoftext|> I really loved the storyline <|endoftext|> Yeah, you gotta have a story to keep you interested. I think Last Christmas has a story that is interesting and fits the season as well. <|endoftext|> Tell me about that movie! I really like seasonal romances as well, especially christmas ones. <|endoftext|> Sure. A young woman (Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones) is working as an elf at a store and nothing's going right for her. It is terrible to be alone during the season, and then suddenly she meets someone and things turn around for her. What do you think? <|endoftext|> Is this the one where the santa is the boss's son? <|endoftext|> Well there is a twist, but I won't give it away. Anyhow, do you think such a movie would be something you're interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do think that would be something I am interested in. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> No problem. Have a good evening. <|endoftext|> Thanks you too!! <|endoftext|> Sorry, I was also wondering if you would consider romantic comedy? <|endoftext|> Yes I would consider romantic comedies. Do you have one in mind? <|endoftext|> Yes, I was thinking of Emma. It was supposed to be based on a good satire. <|endoftext|> I have seen Emma. It is really funny. Have you read the book Emma? It follows the storyline quite closely <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. I usually watch more movies than read books. And no I haven't yet seen it but it looks interesting. Well, anyhow, I hope you enjoy Last Christmas. See ya! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, can I help you find a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed frozen 2 and as wondering if we may speak about or it or can you recommend me a film similar to it? <|endoftext|> What was it you liked about Frozen 2? <|endoftext|> The animation was beautiful and it was nice to see the characters from my childhood again. I thought it was funnier and more interesting than the first one! <|endoftext|> Awesome, do you watch a lot of Disney animated films? <|endoftext|> Whenever I have time! I recently watched the live action Lion King and Inside Out a while back. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Coco? It has beautiful animation and pretty good music too. <|endoftext|> I love that movie! It relates alot to my heritage so that's why I went to go see it. I should watch again in spanish. <|endoftext|> Yes the Spanish version is actually way better, the music is twice as good! Have you seen Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse? It's a little different from the Disney stuff but the animation is absolutely stunning, it won best Animated Feature last year. <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. What's it about? <|endoftext|> It's not your typical comic book movie, the animation is so fascinating it's a must watch for any animation fan. It's hard to explain, the trailer does a better job of explaining it than I ever could. Would you like to watch it? <|endoftext|> Yes! Do you have a link? <|endoftext|> I will at the end but apparently we need to chat a bit more first, haha. Do you like stop motion animation at all? <|endoftext|> I seen some amazing stop animation on youtube! <|endoftext|> Nice, have you watched any of the Wes Anderson stop motion animated movies, Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) or Isle of Dogs (2018)? <|endoftext|> Fantastic Mr.Fox is an old one, I watched it a while back. I haven't heard of Isle of Dogs though. <|endoftext|> If you liked Fantastic Mr.Fox you would probably like Isle of Dogs \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd it definitely has a unique feel which isn't for everyone. Have you seen The Nightmare Before Christmas? That's a classic one and just about the right time of year for it. <|endoftext|> I haven't, even though I should have! I'm definitely looking for something family friendly for the holidays. <|endoftext|> Would you say you are more interested in the trailer for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, or The Nightmare Before Christmas? <|endoftext|> I would say I am more intrested in Spider-Man:Into the Spiderverse. <|endoftext|> Alright great, it was cool chatting with you. Enjoy your weekend! <|endoftext|> Thanks you too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing? <|endoftext|> I am doing moderately well. How about yourself? <|endoftext|> I am doing well, thanks for asking! It's good to hear you're doing well. Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> I just saw Frozen 2 on Tuesday, but that was more for my daughters. I want to find something now for myself to watch? Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> What type of movies are you into? <|endoftext|> I usually lean towards comedies and dramas. I don't like science fiction or action. I can do a thriller if it's intelligent. <|endoftext|> Have you seen or heard of QUOTATION_MARKStep BrothersQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> Yes, I have seen that one. It is quite funny. <|endoftext|> Have you seen QUOTATION_MARKThe FarewellQUOTATION_MARK? Not only does it include drama, but it includes lots of laughter and comedy <|endoftext|> I have not seen QUOTATION_MARKThe FarewellQUOTATION_MARK. Who stars in it? <|endoftext|> Awkwafina, Tzi Ma, and Diana Lin. They all play their roles seamlessly! <|endoftext|> Is it a recent film? Is it still in theaters? <|endoftext|> It is still in some theaters! <|endoftext|> What is it about? <|endoftext|> Here is the synopsis of the movie: QUOTATION_MARKAfter learning their beloved matriarch has terminal lung cancer, a family opts not to tell her about the diagnosis, instead scheduling an impromptu wedding-reunion back in China. Headstrong and emotional writer Billi rebels against her parents' directive to stay in New York and joins the family as they awkwardly attempt to rekindle old bonds, throw together a wedding that only grandma is actually looking forward to, and surreptitiously say their goodbyesQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Hmm. That sounds like a very interesting film. I will definitely have to check it out. What films are on your list to see next? <|endoftext|> I am currently looking to find some new interesting horror films. That is my favorite genre, however, they have not been coming out with many that peek my interest. <|endoftext|> This is true. I also really like horror films and there hasn't been a great one for awhile now. I think television has gotten horror right better than film has recently. <|endoftext|> I agree, have you seen Haunting of Hill House> <|endoftext|> I have. It's quite good. Have you seen QUOTATION_MARKCastle RockQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hey how are you today <|endoftext|> Am fine. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I'm into horror movies but I like comedy as well. <|endoftext|> I have you seen IT Chapter Two <|endoftext|> No not yet, I would love to though. I'll check it out. <|endoftext|> Yes check it out It's a good horror movie <|endoftext|> Any good comedy movies out? I need to have a good laugh. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Deadpool 2 <|endoftext|> I have seen it, it was pretty funny. That came out awhile ago. <|endoftext|> Lol yes it did, what about Good Boys <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that or heard about it. What is it about? <|endoftext|> It's Adventure Comedy came out earlier this year, the trailer is on youtube <|endoftext|> oooo ok I'll check it out thanks! <|endoftext|> You welcome! Have you seen Friday? <|endoftext|> Of course I love that movie! It's a classic. <|endoftext|> Yes! it definitely is <|endoftext|> I actually might find that DVD and watch it tonight. <|endoftext|> That's a good idea, i probably will do that someday <|endoftext|> You should with a cream soda and some popcorn! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Can I help you find a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, please! I want to see a movie over the holidays and I'm curious about what you might suggest and I'm looking for a recommendation. <|endoftext|> Are you wanting a holiday themed movie or are you open to other ideas as well? <|endoftext|> I'm open to other ideas. I tend to like action movies and I can't stand horror flicks. Too scary. I like it when movies have a lot of character development. <|endoftext|> I don't like horror either! Way too scary. What was the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was Captain Marvel and I really liked it. <|endoftext|> Yes! Great movie. Let me see what I can find that I think you will like. <|endoftext|> Awesome. Like I said, I like action films and I typically like nerdy films like Star Wars or Marvel stuff. I like witty humor and banter rather than slap-stick type humor. I like a complex, yet understandable plot. Nothing too QUOTATION_MARKout thereQUOTATION_MARK like Inception or anything. <|endoftext|> 21 Bridges just released and is a movie I definitely want to see. With all the hype surrounding officer involved shootings it has a lot of interest in my opinion. <|endoftext|> Hmm, I've never heard of it. What's the gist? I'm assuming about police shooting people? I tend to get annoyed if movies try to push too hard on a political agenda. <|endoftext|> It's about the opposite. 2 officers are shot in NY and the 21 bridges surrounding the city are shut down as the fugitives are on the run. <|endoftext|> Oh, wow. I never really would have thought it would have been the opposite. Interesting. Is it a true story or just fiction? <|endoftext|> It's fiction. And I had the plot a little bit backwards. 2 fugitives are on the run. 7 officers are killed. Chadwick Boseman stars as the lead detective which is a cool tie to your love of Marvel type movies! <|endoftext|> Oh wow, yeah, that sounds like my type of movie. I will definitely go see it considering that plot and that actor. Thanks for your recommendation! I'll go see that movie over the holiday. <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you really enjoy it and have a happy holiday! <|endoftext|> For sure, thanks. <|endoftext|> You're welcome! <|endoftext|> One last thing, I suppose. I was also considering seeing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.Do you think 21 Bridges would be a better movie? <|endoftext|> Oh that's a tough one! Star Wars is a great franchise and I would hate for you to miss out on that in the theater setting. For me though, I would prefer 21 Bridges and reserve Star Wars for another day. <|endoftext|> Hmm, maybe it would be a good idea to see both of them? But, I still think I'll see 21 Bridges since you recommended it. <|endoftext|> Yes definitely both if you can swing it! <|endoftext|> Perfect. Thanks again for your help and have a great rest of your day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. I can recommend pretty much all open levels of movies in the last twenty years or so. Is there something I can help you find? <|endoftext|> Yes, I'm looking for a good animated movie. <|endoftext|> What are you interested in? We were just talking about the Avengers. <|endoftext|> Well, I'd like a family move. Something that's happy. <|endoftext|> Like Adventure, Fantasy, but not Disney? <|endoftext|> No, I can do a Disney movie. <|endoftext|> I'm not really sure which Disney movie would fit that... but I found a movie titled Jack the Giant Slayer, which I imagine is kind of like the Jack and the Bean Stalk. <|endoftext|> It sounds good. Are there any animal as main character movies? <|endoftext|> There's the CGI movie Avatar, as well. Jack the Giant Slayer is filmed similar to the LoTR saga. <|endoftext|> I'm thinking about something more for children. <|endoftext|> Okay. I saw Avatar in the theaters. It's very imaginative, creative and awe inspiring. <|endoftext|> What is it about? <|endoftext|> I don't remember exactly. The humans have inhabited a new planet populated by blue skinned giants. They've developed a technology to suit themselves to conform into their culture and they explore a new world and make friends with the people. <|endoftext|> And what is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk about? <|endoftext|> I actually don't have the trailer for that. Here's the Google results. When young farmhand Jack (Nicholas Hoult) unwittingly opens a portal between his realm and a race of giants, it rekindles an ancient war. Roaming Earth for the first time in centuries, the fearsome giants seek to reclaim the land they lost long ago. Jack has to face an army of foes that he thought existed only in legend, but through his arduous fight for the kingdom and its people, he may win the love of a brave princess, perhaps becoming a legend himself. <|endoftext|> Well, avatar would be okay then. <|endoftext|> It's a good movie for the kids if they like animated beings and stuff. Also, what's the animated movie with the parents that have super powers, and their kids have them too? <|endoftext|> I don't know. <|endoftext|> Ah, The Incredibles. There. That's a good choice too. <|endoftext|> I would like to see the trailer for that one. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good day, How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am wonderful and yourself ? <|endoftext|> Great; thanks for asking. <|endoftext|> It's a bit cold and rainy where I am at, but just working on staying dry lol <|endoftext|> I can relate. We are getting snow and some cold weather tonight. <|endoftext|> Good weather to stay in and watch movies. Any good recommendations ? <|endoftext|> Absolutely is...I would most definitely like to give you some recommendations, but first what type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I would say that most of what I watch is either a horror movie or action film. <|endoftext|> So what was the last QUOTATION_MARKgoodQUOTATION_MARK movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I went to the movies and saw the Joker. I would say that's what my answer would be. <|endoftext|> That movie looks awesome, unfortunately I haven't had the chance to watch it yet! <|endoftext|> Its a bit of a slow burn psychological thriller, but I would say its worth I watch. I really enjoyed it <|endoftext|> That sounds great. Have you seen the older movie: Natural Born Killers? <|endoftext|> I have not, what is it about? Worth watching? <|endoftext|> It was released in 1994. Starring Woody Heraldson. It is about a serial killer, with a psychopathic behavior. <|endoftext|> Ahh sounds good. I will def have to give that a watch. <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the trailer. <|endoftext|> Yes. I would love to. <|endoftext|> Awesome. I think you will really enjoy it. <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation and will def give it a watch once i make it home. <|endoftext|> Have a wonderful day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing? Have you seen any good movie trailers lately? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. Do you have any to recommend? <|endoftext|> Have you seen the new trailer for Star Wars The Rise of the Skywalkers? <|endoftext|> No, Im not a fan of Star Wars. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you normally like to watch? Action, horror, family? <|endoftext|> Action, Comedies, Romance <|endoftext|> Have you seen the new trailer for Zombie Land  Double Tap movie? <|endoftext|> Yeah I don't really like zombies <|endoftext|> I feel it, what about aliens? I know Men in Black International came out not to long ago. <|endoftext|> Not really of fan of aliens either. Nothing about space, zombies, dinosaurs. <|endoftext|> Gotcha, have you seen the trailer for Booksmart? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. What is it about? <|endoftext|> You haven't? Well I'll try to not spoil it, but basically its about two girls who just graduated high school who graduated with some pretty high marks. They kind of realized they've missed a lot of their teenage experiences so try and make up for that in a night. <|endoftext|> Ooooo I think I saw the previews for that <|endoftext|> what did you think? I think I am going to give watching it a try, I know I feel like that sometimes. Movies like that I feel are needed, kind of reminds us to make time for fun or just enjoying the time we have with friends and family. <|endoftext|> Yeah maybe I'll check it out <|endoftext|> You ever watch Superbad? <|endoftext|> OMG I love Superbad <|endoftext|> I do too! Oh if you're into that kind of humor you really got to check out Good Boys if you haven't already seen it! <|endoftext|> Never heard of it <|endoftext|> Its got that same kind of vibe going on, kind of hard to explain but if you ever get the chance try checking out the trailer <|endoftext|> Yeah I think I will <|endoftext|> Nice! yeah I think I saw it on Hulu or some other something <|endoftext|> Yeah I'll check it out. Thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> Yeah no problem, anytime! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> hi doing well. do you know of any good new action movies? <|endoftext|> there are a lot, So you love action movies? <|endoftext|> oh yes. I also like dark dramas like Joker <|endoftext|> i Like them too, which is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> American Ganster <|endoftext|> wow, what did you love about it? <|endoftext|> the acting and the story. <|endoftext|> anything you didn't like? <|endoftext|> not really. do have any action movie reccomendations with really good acting...say on par with Joker or a clockwork orange? <|endoftext|> I remember you said you like action movies right? <|endoftext|> yes. the transporter type..jason statham <|endoftext|> I would recommend bad boys for life <|endoftext|> oh never heard of that.

What is your movie preference? <|endoftext|> I like anything with action, drama, or adventure. Know of any movies that fit into these genres? <|endoftext|> Actually, yes! I know lots of movies with this criteria. Give me an example of your favorite movie that meets these requirements. <|endoftext|> Fast and Furious Movies, 300, 13 Hours: Soldiers of Benghazi, John Wick, etc <|endoftext|> Okay, that gives me a good idea of what you are looking for. John Wick was a great movie. Now if you could tell me an example of a movie that you didn't like or care for? <|endoftext|> I really didn't care for Blade Runner, it was too dull. Some of the new Star Wars movies are a bit complex for my taste. I want something that's mindless and can take me out of the real world for a while. <|endoftext|> That gives me a great idea of what your taste is... Have you been to the movie theater lately? <|endoftext|> It's been a month or two <|endoftext|> Did you see all the Marvell Avengers? If so already, tell me how you feel about terminator. <|endoftext|> I have seen the Avengers. Not so interested in Terminator <|endoftext|> Have you seen the preview to the new bad boys movie coming out next month? <|endoftext|> No i haven't, is it good? <|endoftext|> It might be a little comedic for you taste, but it should be a good movie. But I think you should definitely check out Bloodshot. Have you heard of it? I really think it's up your alley. <|endoftext|> I have not heard of it, what is it about? <|endoftext|> First of all it has Vin Diesel... he plays a soldier and something happens to him... <|endoftext|> I'm intrigued, are the ratings good? <|endoftext|> I'm going to say it looks good. It gets released in February. I'm not sure if your looking for a future movie or one that is already out. <|endoftext|> I've always got an eye out for good movies coming up. I would love to watch the trailer. <|endoftext|> Okay, I'll send it over to you. It has some Sci-Fi, but I really think you'll enjoy it. You seem like have a taste for war movies. <|endoftext|> I always enjoy a good action/war flick. Go ahead and send it over. Thank you for the recommendation <|endoftext|> No problem. Would you be interested in another recommendation? I'll also send over the new Bad Boys movie. <|endoftext|> That sounds great. Thank you. <|endoftext|> I hope you got the trailer I selected. Have a great day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi! I really like action movies. <|endoftext|> I too like action movies regarding military. <|endoftext|> Cool! Do you have any recommendations for military action movies? <|endoftext|> I like the Rambo series. Do you like it <|endoftext|> I've never seen them. So you recommend Rambo? <|endoftext|> Yes. I recommend the Rambo series. <|endoftext|> Great. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> And have you seen QUOTATION_MARK13 HoursQUOTATION_MARK movie. <|endoftext|> I have not. What is it about? <|endoftext|> It's too about military concept. <|endoftext|> What do you like better? Rambo or 13 hours? <|endoftext|> I prefer Rambo. <|endoftext|> Why do you prefer Rambo? <|endoftext|> Because of the action sequences by Sylvester Stallone are awesome. <|endoftext|> Oh, Sylvester Stallone is in it? He is great. <|endoftext|> Yes. He do every scene with passion in acting. <|endoftext|> Are the other actors as good as him? <|endoftext|> The other actors are also as good as him. <|endoftext|> Nice! I'll watch it. I accept your recommendation of Rambo. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey friend, how are you today? <|endoftext|> Doing great, thanks? Have you seen any good movies recently? <|endoftext|> I see good movies all the time in my opinion. What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I enjoy comedies, thrillers, and action movies usually. <|endoftext|> Are there any actors you prefer <|endoftext|> Yes! I like Ed Norton, Chris Evans, Emma Stone, Brad Pitt, & Margo Robbie a lot. <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of a realistic movie or something that is definitely not something that would happen in real life? <|endoftext|> I can go either way in regards to that, although probably prefer a bit of realism involved. Like comic book movies are good, because there based on at least some plausibility. <|endoftext|> I love comic book movies also. Before I give suggestions, what is one of your favorite movies, and why? <|endoftext|> One of my favorite movies is Se7en, due to the high level of tension involved throughout and I'll always remember how that final reveal at the end made me feel. Just awe stricken. <|endoftext|> I may have a movie that you would like. This actually is based on a true story based on the Zodiac killer. <|endoftext|> Oh, really? I'm interested! Give me some more info! <|endoftext|> In the 1060's-70's there was a killer that would kill (usually) couples. He would send cryptic messages to the police <|endoftext|> Is this the Robert Downey Jr. & Jake Gyllenhaal movie? Directed by David Fincher? <|endoftext|> Yes it is, A lot of people put it into the same type of movie as se7en in the way the movie plays out. Plus, it's all based on a true story <|endoftext|> Oh, that sounds great! I accept your recommendation and will definitely check that one out! <|endoftext|> I'm going to show us the trailer, but let me tell you this movie is so crazy and yet amazing I still read about the real zodiac <|endoftext|> Ok, let me see it. <|endoftext|> okay let me figure out how to. I see Rotten Tomatoes gave it 89% which is amazing for them <|endoftext|> It's ok, I trust your recommendation if you can't find a way to share the trailer. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, are you looking for some movie recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yes I would love a good Sci fi movie or something like the movie ALIENS <|endoftext|> I can help you with that. Have you seen the Alien vs Predator movie or are you looking for something more current? <|endoftext|> I have seen that one, I'm looking for something current <|endoftext|> Do you like horror type alien movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I do <|endoftext|> Okay. Have you seen the new trailer for Rise of Skywalker yet? <|endoftext|> Yes I do not like that movie sadly. How about a good Sci Fi movie in general? <|endoftext|> Did you see Terminator Dark Fate? <|endoftext|> Yes I didn't like the fact they killed John Carter in the first 5 min of the movie. How about something about Predator that is recent. <|endoftext|> The Predator was the most recent release they had out. Do you like anime sci fi? Alita Battle Angel was a pretty interesting movie. <|endoftext|> Yes I loved Alita Battle Angel, I am excited they are bringing out a sequel. <|endoftext|> I can't wait to see that myself. I really enjoyed the first one even though the reviews didn't seem so great. <|endoftext|> I think there was Bias due to Capt Marvel SJW flack. I think I will watch The Predator thank you! <|endoftext|> You're welcome. I hope you like it. <|endoftext|> How about a Current comedy something like The Hangover. <|endoftext|> Do you like animated films? <|endoftext|> I love animated films like Akira <|endoftext|> So would you like something like Frozen 2? It's a kids film but it does have adult humor in it. The little snowman in it is quite hilarious. <|endoftext|> I think I would prefer something along the lines of Japanese animated films. They are more adult and care more for the story then politics. <|endoftext|> I see. Have you seen the new Men in Black International movie that came out recently. There's comedy and sci-fi for you. <|endoftext|> Yes didn't like it. I want a Japanese animated film to watch. <|endoftext|> How about Ghost in the Machine with Scarlett Johansson. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> Yes it was wonderful but it's not what I asked for. I want a Anime film in English. <|endoftext|> I'm apologize. I believe that movie is in English. Let me see if I can find something else for you. <|endoftext|> I am done thank you. <|endoftext|> Have a nice evening. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I am here to help you select a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Great! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I like comedies and science fiction movies <|endoftext|> I personally loved Liar Liar. Jim Carrey is hilarious! <|endoftext|> oh ya, that was a classic that I have not seen in years. Jim Carey used to be my favorite <|endoftext|> It would be a funny world if people could not lie. Jim Carrey portrayed what that world would be like and it was hilarious. <|endoftext|> I agree totally. It would turn the world upside down <|endoftext|> That's the first that came to mind when you said you wanted to see a comedy. That was a comedy classic. <|endoftext|> I would like to watch that movie again since it has been such a long time since I have seen it. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> yes please <|endoftext|> I have selected the movie for you. Great choice! <|endoftext|> Thanks, it has been great chatting with you <|endoftext|> Same. It is always great finding another movie Buff! <|endoftext|> I am definetly a movie buff <|endoftext|> What's your favorite movie you've ever seen? <|endoftext|> Honestly, I'm kinda stuck on Avengers Endgame at the moment. Either that or Avatar <|endoftext|> I've never seen those. I'm not much on Science Fiction. Except for of course the classic. Star Trek! <|endoftext|> I love me some Star Trek. Ive seen every series except for the origianl <|endoftext|> Same.Well I guess i'm going to go. It has been great chatting with you! <|endoftext|> Same, have a good day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I would like to help you by recommending a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Please, go ahead. <|endoftext|> what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Action movies. <|endoftext|> Great! What was the most recent action movie you saw? <|endoftext|> A John Wayne western, McClintock. <|endoftext|> I have never seen that movie. What was your favorite part of the movie? <|endoftext|> The western genre is interesting to me. <|endoftext|> Do you like just old Western movies or more modern ones as well? <|endoftext|> Mostly older ones, some newer ones have been good also. <|endoftext|> I'm ready to make a recommendation <|endoftext|> Go ahead. <|endoftext|> The Hateful Eight <|endoftext|> I have not seen this movie. <|endoftext|> It's a Quintin Tarantino Movie <|endoftext|> I have heard of it, just not seen it yet. Is it extra violent? <|endoftext|> it's pretty violent, it takes place in the winter probably in the 1800s in the wild west. <|endoftext|> I don't like graphic violence, which is why I tend toward the older westerns. <|endoftext|> Then how about this moive:  Hostiles. It's a western; cowboys and indians without a lot of violence <|endoftext|> I have seen parts of this movie, not the whole thing though. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> I'm here to help you look for a movie that may fit your interests <|endoftext|> Great, thank you. I like a lot of different kinds of movies. Not gory, but suspense is great. I don't mind psychological thrillers but not slasher or horror movies. I also really enjoy period movies like Downton Abby and that type. <|endoftext|> That's awesome <|endoftext|> I also enjoy some romantic comedies, but not ones that are too QUOTATION_MARKfluffyQUOTATION_MARK or QUOTATION_MARKhigh school QUOTATION_MARKishQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Yeah, I totally understand that. I definitely think psychological thrillers are great. Have you seen some of the very popular ones, I don't know, like QUOTATION_MARKShutter IslandQUOTATION_MARK for example? <|endoftext|> Actually no, I haven't seen that one. What's the basis of that? <|endoftext|> It's about a detective who is investigating a missing patient at an asylum on an island <|endoftext|> That sounds good...right up my alley. Not too many blood and guts? <|endoftext|> No, definitely not. There's very little of that. Like, you see some guy get beat up a bit for one scene, but for the most part it's all about the story and dialogue. It's a great movie. <|endoftext|> That sounds great. I actually think I'll watch it tonight!! Thanks for the suggestion! <|endoftext|> You're welcome. <|endoftext|> Have a great night!! Any other suggestions before I go? <|endoftext|> No, not really. But Shutter Island is also a bit older. Have you seen QUOTATION_MARKIt Comes at Night?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen that one either. What's that one about? I wonder if I can find Shutter Island on Netflix. <|endoftext|> It's also really good. There's a bit more blood in that one, but only briefly. And it isn't like the gory slasher kind of blood scene <|endoftext|> Is it more sci-fi? Or detective? <|endoftext|> So maybe a little more sci-fi, but not too much. The setting of the movie is after some disease has unfortunately wiped out most of the population. There is no real form of government, so people are looking after themselves and looking out for potential threats (mostly from other people trying to survive). But it's really more so from the perspective of this very shielded/protected teenager <|endoftext|> Oh, that sounds good too. I have watched a couple of other QUOTATION_MARKvirusQUOTATION_MARK type movies like that. Survival and everything...they're good. Thanks for the recommendations. I'm going to check out both of those. That's awesome. <|endoftext|> And to try to help out with your previous question, QUOTATION_MARKShutter IslandQUOTATION_MARK may be available for you to watch on Hulu <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer <|endoftext|> i am looking for a scary movie. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the Shining? I think the prequel QUOTATION_MARKDoctor SleepQUOTATION_MARK looks pretty good <|endoftext|> i have seen the Shinning and loved it, i would like to see Doctor Sleep. when does it come out? <|endoftext|> Its already out. it hit theaters on November 8, but it should be still playing <|endoftext|> oh ok, ill have to see what movie theaters near me are still playing it. keeping my fingers crossed. <|endoftext|> what was the last movie you've seen? <|endoftext|> in theaters? <|endoftext|> yes, sorry, I should have been more specific <|endoftext|> last movie i saw in theaters was Toy Story 4 <|endoftext|> Did you enjoy it? I think everything after the first one went down hill <|endoftext|> nah, all the Toy Story movies were great. they each had something in it for everyone <|endoftext|> Well, to be fair, i wasnt even a huge fan of the first one, so I'm not the best judge. Anyway, back to Doctor Sleep, are you a fan of the cast (Ewan McGregor and Rebecca Furguson) or are you just interested in the story? <|endoftext|> i like the cast and the story seems interesting so ill probably go see it <|endoftext|> Cool, i haven't seen it yet either, but i intend to. There's just too many things coming out recently for me to keep up <|endoftext|> same, so many options so little tie <|endoftext|> Honestly, I'm running out of things to say lol, but they won't let me leave yet. So...I'm especially looking forward to Ewan McGregor's performance, i really like him as an actor and I think he'll excel in this role <|endoftext|> same here, you know any other good movies out right now? <|endoftext|> Ford Vs Ferrari was really good in my opinion and I'm lookinf forward to Knives Out, but I haven't seen it yet. You? <|endoftext|> what is knives out about <|endoftext|> Its a kind of murder mystery where a bunch of people come to a mansion for a will reading and start getting picked off. <|endoftext|> oh that sounds good, ill have to look into that one <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, how are you today? can i help you find a movie you might like? <|endoftext|> Hi there, I am well, thank you. I am looking for a family comedy. Any ideas? <|endoftext|> which actors are your favorites? <|endoftext|> Of course Tom Hanks is always a favorite.Although we have seen most of his films. We also like Hugh Grant. <|endoftext|> would you like a recommendation for a new movie or any time period? <|endoftext|> Any time period would be just fine. <|endoftext|> do you want to see any type of comedy or a perticular sub-genre <|endoftext|> We like any type of comedy....family friendly. <|endoftext|> ok how about i find a good comedy staring hugh grant for you? <|endoftext|> Sounds great! <|endoftext|> how about QUOTATION_MARKtwo weeks noticeQUOTATION_MARK staring hugh grant & sandra bullock, it looks to be entertaining? <|endoftext|> Ahh, we have not seen that one yet.

I dont like thrillers that are short. I feel like they make the movie less realistic <|endoftext|> it has glenn close and michael douglas. i think you would like it. <|endoftext|> ohhh well I do like Glenn Close. I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|> what other glenn close movies do you like <|endoftext|> you might laugh but i like her in 100 and 1 dalmations <|endoftext|> yes she was good in that. <|endoftext|> i thought so too, what else have you seen her in? <|endoftext|> i always get her confused with meryl streep. :)  i also think you might like basic instinct with sharon stone and michael douglas <|endoftext|> i dont like sharron stone <|endoftext|> oh ok then you won't like basic instinct! <|endoftext|> yeah. I do think I will like fatal attraction <|endoftext|> that will be my recommendation for you then. nice chatting with you! <|endoftext|> you too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> hi what genre do you like <|endoftext|> I like comedies and sci-fi.

How about you? <|endoftext|> i was fine not all up to the hype <|endoftext|> Yeah, if it hadn't been hyped as much, I think you would have liked it better <|endoftext|> did you go to a movie theater or watch it  at home <|endoftext|> Home. It didn't stay in theaters long enough for me to go see it <|endoftext|> cool.i remand you watch  guardians of the galaxy or star wars mandalorian thanks again <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi I am looking for a movie trailer. I like anything that's a comedy. <|endoftext|> What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Burlesque (2010) <|endoftext|> Okay! Are you looking for a movie trailer similar to this (drama/romance) or still just comedy? <|endoftext|> Just a comedy <|endoftext|> I was really impressed with Where'd You Go Bernadette. I thought it was the perfect combination of funny and interesting. <|endoftext|> Okay thank you for your help I will check it out! <|endoftext|> Great! I watched it with some of my friends and we really enjoyed it. Kind of quirky as well. I hope you are able to enjoy it as well. <|endoftext|> Thanks so much! <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would <|endoftext|> I think you will really enjoy it! It has Cate Blanchett in it. <|endoftext|> Thanks I will watch it! <|endoftext|> Do you like mysteries? <|endoftext|> Yeah I do <|endoftext|> That is another reason why I enjoyed this movie. It's funny and has a little bit of mystery involved with it too. It's the perfect balance I think. <|endoftext|> Yeah I watched the trailer and it looks really good im gonna watch it now. Thank you so much. <|endoftext|> Of course! I am so glad that you are as intrigued as I was when I watched the trailer. I really hope you are able to enjoy the movie as well. <|endoftext|> Yeah thank you so much, I had never heard of this movie before so i'm glad it was recommended to me. <|endoftext|> I never had either, but once I watched the trailer I knew I had to watch it. Sometimes I have such a hard time finding a good quality movie. It's the ones you do not hear about that surprise you sometimes! <|endoftext|> Yeah I know thanks again! <|endoftext|> No problem! I was surprised that I had never heard of it and especially becasue Cate Blanchett is in big movies such as Indiana Jones, Lord of the Rings, Ocean's 8, etc. She really is a great actress I think. Do you like movies like Lord of the Rings and Indiana Jones? <|endoftext|> Yeah i do I haven't watched all of the movies in each series but ive seen some from each and I really like them. <|endoftext|> That's how I am too! Especially with Harry Potter and Star Wars movies. They are not really part of my favorite genre, but I have watched a few from each series. Have you watched Harry Potter or Star Wars? <|endoftext|> Yeah Ive seen all of the Harry Potter movies but i've seen only some of the Star Wars movies. I really like both franchises though. <|endoftext|> I am the opposite. I have seen only some of Harry Potter and almost all of Star Wars. I think they both are a nice change <|endoftext|> Yeah I really like both. It's interesting to see how Star Wars paved the way for a story like Harry Potter, their plots both follow the cycle of the hero's journey. <|endoftext|> Yes isn't that interesting? I am glad that someone else sees that connection as well. Both are a great series, just takes a long time to finish them! <|endoftext|> Yes I think both series also set a standard for having multiple sequels to movies now, mostly as a cash grab, since I don't think their have been many series that have come out recently that are that interesting. I think after Hunger Games we haven't really had any good movie series come out that weren't piggybacking off of the Hunger Games dystopia hype. <|endoftext|> Yes I agree! It is crazy how hard it is to find a quality movie these days because of the great movies that were made in the past. <|endoftext|> Yes especially with all of the reboots too! <|endoftext|> Yes I could not agree more! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you? Are you enjoy watching movies? <|endoftext|> Hello. I'm well. How are you. Yes, I enjoy watching movies. You? <|endoftext|> Me too. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds. Fantasy, action/adventure, scary and murder/mystery. <|endoftext|> Sounds good. What you typically looking in movies? What makes you watch it? <|endoftext|> Something that will hold my interest. <|endoftext|> Any movies you watched recently and liked it so much? <|endoftext|> I've seen Charlie's Angels and The Exorcist. <|endoftext|> The Exorcist is really great thriller/mystery. I also liked it. Charlie's Angels is recent movie if I remember correctly. <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen the recent one. <|endoftext|> So did you watch Charlie's Angels? It's this year movie. <|endoftext|> No. I have not watched the new Charlie's <|endoftext|> Ok. But do you want to watch it? It's cool action movie. <|endoftext|> No. I would rather a thriller/mystery. <|endoftext|> Do you use Netflix? <|endoftext|> Yes. <|endoftext|> Have you ever about the movie called QUOTATION_MARK1922QUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> No. <|endoftext|> It's about a farmer to Nebraska, where he sets on the path to write a confession for a murder from his past. The Netflix is adapted from a Stephen King novella. <|endoftext|> I reject 1922. Any other? <|endoftext|> Black Hawk Down. It's about US invasion to Somalia. It's so cool movie. <|endoftext|> I accept. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hey whats up! <|endoftext|> Not much! So, what types of films do you like <|endoftext|> im more into action movies and those that can get me hooked into the story <|endoftext|> Alright, and what types of movies do you NOT enjoy? <|endoftext|> movies that have very simple plots <|endoftext|> Got it! I would recommend a movie called Kill Bill, vol. 1, if you enjoy action films! <|endoftext|> ive heard of it! ill have to watch the trailer, is there more than 1 kill bill? <|endoftext|> There are two Kill Bill films, vol. 1 and vol. 2, both are great films! <|endoftext|> awesome, ill definitely be checking them both out! <|endoftext|> The movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino, an incredible director! <|endoftext|> good to know, hopefully he has more great films <|endoftext|> Definitely. It has an 85% on Rotten Tomatoes as well, so it is enjoyed by most people who watch it. <|endoftext|> just watched the trailer and now i want to watch it! i might now! <|endoftext|> That's great to hear! I hope you enjoy it if you do end up watching it! <|endoftext|> thank you and thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> It's my pleasure, hope you have a great day! <|endoftext|> you as well <|endoftext|> thanks so much! <|endoftext|> no problem! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> I am looking for a movie recommendation. I have been pretty bored lately. <|endoftext|> What Genres are you interested in? <|endoftext|> My favorite genre is horror but I also enjoy dramas like gangster and war movies and I like comedies but not romantic ones. <|endoftext|> Good choices! Can you name a couple of the most recent movies you have watched? <|endoftext|> Recently, Doctor Sleep, Joker, In The Mouth of Madness. <|endoftext|> Great! I am looking forward to seeing Joker soon as well. Do you like movies that make your heart race? <|endoftext|> I suppose I do. I like horror, some thrillers, and I like action movies but I'm picky about them. Fury Road was amazing. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen the shallows? This is the one about a surfer who gets caught at see and has trouble with a vicious shark? That one really got my heart pumping <|endoftext|> I did see The Shallows. I liked it. On a similar note I saw Crawl recently which I also enjoyed. <|endoftext|> I got the perfect movie for you, just recently came out and i went to see it in theaters this past weekend! Will really get you thinking, also hope you like plot twists! <|endoftext|> I love twisty movies. A twist done well like The Sixth Sense or Wild Things is so much fun. <|endoftext|> Check out this trailer for 21 bridges then! <|endoftext|> What is it about? <|endoftext|> It is about a criminal that is being tracked by NYPD in manhatten..chase is getting so intense that they end up closing all 21 bridges in and out of manhatten. <|endoftext|> That sounds very interesting. Do you know any of the cast? <|endoftext|> Yes, the main character, Chadwick Boseman. He was also the main character in Black Panther, which was a great movie as well. <|endoftext|> He was very good in that even though I was not a big fan of the movie. I would certainly give this movie a try. <|endoftext|> Awesome, so would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would. Thank you so much for helping me find a movie. <|endoftext|> You're very welcome! Enjoy :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> well, and you? <|endoftext|> Great, can yo help me with finding a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Absolutely. What genre of movies to you like? <|endoftext|> Sci-fi and Action <|endoftext|> Me too! What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Avengers: Endgame <|endoftext|> Nice! A great end to a huge series of movies! <|endoftext|> I loved it. <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy movies about space? <|endoftext|> Yes I do. <|endoftext|> Awesome! I recommend one of my personal favorites, Interstellar <|endoftext|> Does it have good action in it? <|endoftext|> Oh yes! Lot's of space travel and intense scenes <|endoftext|> Awesome, thanks for your recommendation, I will check it out <|endoftext|> Great. Here's some info  Plot:  A team of explorers travel through a wormhole in space in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival. Actors: Ellen Burstyn, Matthew McConaughey, Mackenzie Foy, John Lithgow  Directors: Christopher Nolan  Production: Paramount Pictures  Awards: Won 1 Oscar. Another 43 wins & 143 nominations. Ratings: Internet Movie Database: 8.6/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 72%, Metacritic: 74/100 <|endoftext|> Thanks, I like it already! <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy! Do you accept this recommendation? <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hello. I'm looking for something sort of action-y, but with an intelligent plot and some comedy. I really really liked RED and RED 2, for example. <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie with similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> Similar would be cool. Spy movies are awesome! <|endoftext|> I enjoyed The Operative. The plot was innovative, nuanced, and entirely credible. How does that sound? <|endoftext|> It looks really cool. I accept the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Excellent! Diane Kruger gives a quietly intense, steely performance in this action thriller. <|endoftext|> Yeah! I like what I see so far plot wise... but I also see it's kinda lowly ranked on Rotten Tomatoes. Perhaps something with a higher rating but similar in style? <|endoftext|> Okay, What is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> Un-related, but I watched Jojo Rabbit in theaters. I enjoyed it <|endoftext|> Oh yes that movie was pretty funny. <|endoftext|> It was funny, but it also was sad. I hated that Jojo's mother died. <|endoftext|> That was a difficult scene. I remember you said you like spy and action movies. The Angel has fallen is about Secret Service Agent Mike Banning, played by Gerard Butler who framed for the attempted assassination of the President. It also has Morgan Freeman in it. <|endoftext|> Yeah! I saw it semi recently and it was pretty good. Good recommendation! <|endoftext|> Great! Have you seen Domino yet? <|endoftext|> I have not! It looks right up my ally plotwise, so despite the low rotten tomatoes rating, I accept the recommendation! <|endoftext|> The movie has more visual spark than most of the blockbusters rolling off the assembly line this summer. It is about a Copenhagen police officer named Christian who seeks justice for his partner's murder by an ISIS member <|endoftext|> Sounds great. I wanna watch it. <|endoftext|> Excellent! I think you will really enjoy Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's character in this movie. <|endoftext|> I do as well and am excited to see it. I accept all your recommendations. Thank you for the chat. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! Do you like movies about space? <|endoftext|> yeah a lot. <|endoftext|> Okay great! How about movies with some action and drama? <|endoftext|> very much ,i always feel engaged on the act. <|endoftext|> Well, there's a movie out called Rise of Skywalker. It's part of the Star Wars franchise. Would you like to see the trailer for it? <|endoftext|> Oh yeah i very interested to check it out <|endoftext|> You know, all of those Star Wars movies have been excellent! I think you will definitely like it! <|endoftext|> sure.i am looking forward to see the trailer,it will be fascinating to watch. <|endoftext|> It really will! I just know you will want to see the movie after seeing this! <|endoftext|> yes,definitely,the way you have described it seems to be cool <|endoftext|> Oh you know, if you like older movies I did want to mention Independence Day.

What was the last thing you watched? <|endoftext|> The Joker movie <|endoftext|> That movie had alot of emotional appeal. Phoenix certainly gave a compelling performance. What was your favorite part? <|endoftext|> The climax portion.The convo between the joker and the Murray.What was your's favorite part? <|endoftext|> I like when he fought back in the subway. The transformation he goes through is an emotional one. <|endoftext|> That was the turning point of the movie! Must a favorite one <|endoftext|> Agreed.Instant classic for sure.\\ <|endoftext|> This movie must declare an Oscar <|endoftext|> I recommend Crimson Peak as it is another Thriller with an emotional and compelling main character. <|endoftext|> What was the name of the movie? <|endoftext|> Crimson Peak <|endoftext|> Surely I will watch it <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it! It's one of my personal favorites. <|endoftext|> Sure I watch and post an review about the movie <|endoftext|> Great! Del toro is one of the best directors out there. <|endoftext|> Oh love to heard more about him <|endoftext|> He's a Spanish Director. Also did the now famous Pan's Labyrinth. <|endoftext|> Eager to watch his movies <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello are you ready for a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> Yes, absolutely! Please help! <|endoftext|> What kinds of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like feel-good movies. And I love animated movies. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Rain Man? <|endoftext|> Yes, that's a great flick! <|endoftext|> What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I just watched the holiday. Basically because it is the holidays. <|endoftext|> If you like holiday movies you might like Elf. <|endoftext|> Oh I think that sounds great. Sounds like a holiday flick. Who is in it? <|endoftext|> Will Ferrell, it has one a couple awards and has an 83% rating on rotten tomatoes <|endoftext|> Oh, that does sound good. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would!!! Sounds great! <|endoftext|> Okay I have to send a couple more chats, have you seen Step Brothers? <|endoftext|> yes! hilarious! <|endoftext|> what time is it where you are? <|endoftext|> 11pm. you? <|endoftext|> 9pm you may have time to watch the movie! <|endoftext|> yep. sounds great <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well how about yourself? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great. I was hoping to talk to you about movies. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I'm a big fan of movies in general. I'd say my favorite genres are comedies and action movies though. <|endoftext|> Sounds good. See any good movies lately that you liked? Either in theater or at home? <|endoftext|> I recently saw 1917 in theaters and really enjoyed it! <|endoftext|> That movie was really good. I liked how they made a lot of the movie seem like it was a single shot. Really drew me into the action of it. <|endoftext|> I agree! I also really enjoyed the acting. I thought the casting was perfect for the movie. <|endoftext|> What kind of comedies do you like? Anything you've seen recently that was good? <|endoftext|> I watched The Other Guys on Netflix last night before bed. It was hilarious! <|endoftext|> Do you like other Will Ferrell movies? <|endoftext|> I do! Do you have any other Will Ferrell movies you could recommend to watch? <|endoftext|> I think if you liked The Other Guys you would really like Daddy's Home as well. Its Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg together and there are a lot of funny moments. <|endoftext|> I did love the two of them together! I have not seen Daddy's Home either. Could you tell me a little about the plot? <|endoftext|> Will Ferrell in the movie is a radio host and he ends up getting married to a woman with children. Things get difficult when the biological father, who is played by Mark Wahlberg, returns and steps back into their lives. <|endoftext|> Interesting! This is a great recommendation and will be the next movie I watch when I'm searching for a movie. Thanks! <|endoftext|> You're welcome. Its funny because Will Ferrell plays a more uptight straight laced guy and Mark Wahlberg drives a motorcycle and is more of a rebel. They play off of each other very well. <|endoftext|> I am excited to watch! It will be interesting to see Will Ferrell as uptight since he's usually so loose and goofy, and I'm a fan of a lot of Malk Wahlberg's movie's. He can do serious and comedy roles very well. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer for the movie to get a better idea of what its about? <|endoftext|> Sure! That would be great! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello dear, how are you?. bump on a good trailer for a movie starring Will Smith <|endoftext|> HEY THIS IS SEM <|endoftext|> how are you? <|endoftext|> I AM DOING WELL <|endoftext|> I recommend that you see the trailer of Gemini man <|endoftext|> NO I DID NOT SEE THAT TRAILER, HOW IS THAT <|endoftext|> damn, its a bomb. Will Smith really got the movie intriguing <|endoftext|> YEAH. BUT I DID NOT SEE THAT TRAILER, I WATCHED terminator dark fate <|endoftext|> Ok , haven't seen this trailer either but looking forward to seeing the entire movie GEMINI MAN..... <|endoftext|> I THINK IT'S DEAMA MOVIE <|endoftext|> YEP, ITS A GOOD MOVIE.ACTUALLY ACTION FILLED. <|endoftext|> have see the movie that movie, it seem to mysterious movie to me, like magic <|endoftext|> YEP, OK,,,,YOU SHOULD ALSO SEE THE TRAILER OF FAST AND FURIOUS HOOBS AND SHAWN STARRING JASON STATTAN AND DWANE JOHNSON <|endoftext|> i watched hoobs and shawn it really great movie funny as well <|endoftext|> YEP , FUNNY, HAVE YOU SEEN THE TRAILER OF MELIFICIENT 2 2019 STARRING ANGELINA JOLIE <|endoftext|> YEP,  malificient movie is great as well. <|endoftext|> YOU SHOULD SEE JUNGLE CRUISE TRAILER 2020.WAT A BOMB.

Was really nice speaking with you dear. <|endoftext|> you are awesome <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! how are you? What type of movie do you like? <|endoftext|> Hi there - I am a big fan of fantasy and horror, Stephen King, etc. Got any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Cool! Have you seen The Shining? What about Stephen King's IT? If you are a fan of horror movies you will like these <|endoftext|> Oh, I like the IT. I think I will accept that recommendation and check it out. Thanks so much :) <|endoftext|> Okay sounds good. We still have to talk back and forth for several more turns. So let me ask you. Have you seen the old version of QUOTATION_MARKIt?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Oh, I did not realize. I actually did see the 1990 version (on TV). Which one do you think is better - new or old? <|endoftext|> Well I think the new version is creepier in my opinion. But not sure the chapter II is that good. <|endoftext|> Not sure how old you are, but the 1990 version was soooooo long - I think Tim Robbins was the best Pennywise, but I agree - I think there are some better elements in the new version. Have not seen Chapter II yet, but was impressed with what they did in the reboot <|endoftext|> I see you are a fan of Tim Robbins! Well I do agree the old version is very fun. If you haven't checked out the Chapter II of It, I recommend it! <|endoftext|> I definitely will check it out - are you a Stephen King fan? <|endoftext|> Yes of course! I am sorry but it seems that we don't have the trailer ready for you. Let's talking about Stephen King's the Shining. How do you like the movie? <|endoftext|> The Shining was solid. Obviously, the Jack Nicholson version was a classic. A favorite definitely. I also liked a little known TV film and book called Rose Red...underrated. <|endoftext|> Great! I see you and I have a lot in common! I feel exactly the same about the Shining. Though I don't know much about Rose Red, it sounds great too. <|endoftext|> I love the Shining, but of the recommendations, right now, I think I will definitely stick with IT. Any others you think I may like? <|endoftext|> I am sorry but we don't have the trailer for IT. Would you care for QUOTATION_MARKDoctor Sleep?QUOTATION_MARK It is about The Shining <|endoftext|> Oh, Doctor Sleep sounds amazing. I have heard great things...and honestly, forgot about it. That would be great if you have the trailer. <|endoftext|> Yes. I highly recommend it. The little boy from the Shining is fully grown in this one. Sounds cool huh? <|endoftext|> I heard a little about the plot. Ewan McGregor lead, right? <|endoftext|> Yes. Are you a fan of Ewan McGregor? I think he is an amazing actor <|endoftext|> Of course. Got into Trainspotting in college (yes, I am old) - a classic. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Hey! How are you doing today? I usually like Fantasy movies, maybe with some action and romance. I'm not big on thrillers, I do watch scary movies though. <|endoftext|> Do you like older movies? <|endoftext|> Depends on how old, I usually like movies from the 80's - current time. There are a few older movies that I enjoy, just not many. <|endoftext|> Do you like movies with puppets? <|endoftext|> No actually! Puppets freak me out haha Now puppies on the other hand, I can deal with that. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> A movie called Hush, it's about a deaf woman who is fighting off a man who is trying to kill her. Kind of a Slasher movie. <|endoftext|> Did you like Scream? <|endoftext|> This may sound crazy, but I've never seen Scream. I've heard it's good though, and it sounds like a movie I would like. <|endoftext|> I like Scream the plots of all the movies keep twisting. <|endoftext|> It sounds interesting! I'll have to watch it sometime soon, thank you for letting me know. <|endoftext|> How scary of a movie are you willing to see? <|endoftext|> As long as it doesn't involve torturing an animal I'm willing to watch it. <|endoftext|> Same. I know which one I would not recommend! <|endoftext|> Yay! That's great to hear. <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the Scream trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure! That sounds great <|endoftext|> Ok coming up <|endoftext|> Cool! Thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you doing today!? <|endoftext|> I am doing great, how about you? <|endoftext|> I am not bad! I just saw Frozen 2 this weekend have you seen that movie? <|endoftext|> No, I did see Frozen 1 with my grandkids a few years ago and enjoyed it. I am looking for more of an adult movie with action. <|endoftext|> Do you also like sweet cars with a good soundtrack? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do. I heard there is a movie playing about Fords and some other car racing. <|endoftext|> Oh Ford v Ferrari! I saw that one too. It has alot of energy in the realm of what you might be looking for. Its fast, but not overly furious <|endoftext|> Yes, that's the one I have heard about. This is a movie I really want to see. Thanks so much for your help. <|endoftext|> no problem! I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did <|endoftext|> I am sure I will. I love car races. <|endoftext|> I could also recommend baby driver for a more guns and shooting style movie with cars. Its classic bank robbery, but focused on the getaway driver <|endoftext|> Is it like Bonnie and Clyde? <|endoftext|> It could definitely be compared as a modern day Bonnie and Clyde <|endoftext|> I will think about that movie, and other movies you recommend? <|endoftext|> It depends what else you are into. Have you seen John Wick 2? That is a really good sequel to the first <|endoftext|> No, I haven't heard of that movie. Is it an action movie? <|endoftext|> yes. Keanu Reeves from the Matrix is the star. I highly recommend the first John Wick if you haven't seen it. He's an assassin who just retired, but is forced back into the lifestyle for some sweet revenge. Its probably one of the best action movies of the decade <|endoftext|> I really do like Keanu Reeves. I do like this type of action movie also. I like anything like NCIS, FB <|endoftext|> Then you also might like SEVEN. Its got an NCIS feeling to it with a police investigation into a serial killer whos motivates are the seven deadly sins <|endoftext|> That also sound like a movie I would like. It's hard to tell sometimes when you read reviews. <|endoftext|> Ford V Ferrari would be my top recommendation for you right now. I think you would really enjoy it especially if you like the car racing! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there im here to help you find a movie! <|endoftext|> Hello, I love drama/ mystery movies. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> sure do! whats the last mystery drama movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> The last mystery movie I watched was Zodiac. <|endoftext|> Zodiac was good, did you like it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I did enjoy the movie... My favorite actor is Harrison Ford, I would like a recommendation on his recent movie instead. I can not remember the name of the movie. <|endoftext|> Ah! I love Harrison Ford, His latest movie was Call of the Wild have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> Yes, Call of the Wild. I would like to request a recommendation for that movie. I have not seen it. I have heard great reviews! Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> I havent just yet its still in the theaters too! It looks really good have you seen the trailer yet? <|endoftext|> Yes, I have seen the trailer, it looks entertaining. <|endoftext|> Yes it does! Would you watch it in the theaters or when it comes out on DVD? <|endoftext|> I really would like to see that movie before it comes out on DVD. Can you recommend me a interesting movie? A good one you have seen recently? <|endoftext|> Since you like drama the latest movie I watched was Underground 6 have you seen it? <|endoftext|> No I haven't seen it. Great recommendation. I will accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> It was really good! really worth the watch <|endoftext|> Awesome! I will defiantly check that movie out! <|endoftext|> Its 6 underground haha sorry I went dyslexic for a moment haha. I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Oh yes, I knew what you meant! I have seen the trailer before, Do you know if that movie is on Netflix? <|endoftext|> Yes it is! that's where I watched it on :) <|endoftext|> Great, I have Netflix. I will check that out this weekend! <|endoftext|> Cool! I hope you enjoy call of the wild too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Lets talk about some new action movies. <|endoftext|> Okay, what is the last action movie you have watched? <|endoftext|> The last action movie that I have watched was Avengers End Game. <|endoftext|> Okay, I would recommend john wick 3 or the new rambo movie, for action. <|endoftext|> Okay I prefer the new rambo. <|endoftext|> Great, so would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would like to watch it. <|endoftext|> Do you remember the old Rambo moivees? <|endoftext|> Yes I have seen some of the older Rambo movies. That looks like such a great movie to watch. <|endoftext|> I know right, I think you will like it if you like action. <|endoftext|> I do like it and I definitely going to see the full movie. <|endoftext|> Cool, I am glad I could recommend something you will watch and probably love. <|endoftext|> The part that I like the most is him having to go against all the bad guys to save the young woman. <|endoftext|> That is always a classic. For being so old, he is still taking care of himself. <|endoftext|> Yes I noticed that especially when they were showing flashes of his young self he really doesn't look that different. <|endoftext|> It is a tie between him and Arnold as my favorite action hero of all time. <|endoftext|> Yea I agree, I love Arnold and I hope he doesn't ever stop making the terminator series. <|endoftext|> I hope Van Damme makes a comeback. He was awesome as well. <|endoftext|> Yea I agree I haven't heard anything from him for a while. <|endoftext|> I do not think I can end this. Can you end this on your end? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm fine, how are you? <|endoftext|> It's freezing where I am at, but I am snuggled up nice and warm. <|endoftext|> That's great, glad you're comfy. So, I'd like a movie recommendation. I like horror, drama, and foreign films. <|endoftext|> Being all cozy, I have tons of movies I like to watch. Personally I am into thrillers, comedy, and of course action. What genre do you prefer when it's time to relax and watch a movie? <|endoftext|> I really like to watch horror in that case. <|endoftext|> I completely understand, what was the last horror movie you have seen? <|endoftext|> I think it was an anthology movie called Holidays. Kind of cheesy, but I like that. <|endoftext|> I got ya, I know there are plenty of cheesy horror movies out there. Do you prefer slasher (blood and gore), ghost and ghouls, or just a good old fashion blonde running up the stairway for no apparent reason <|endoftext|> Definitely not a slasher person, but I like a ghost or a good twist ending. <|endoftext|> I am also a fan of the twisted ending, I love to have to figure it out or be totally wrong the whole way through <|endoftext|> same here! Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> How about the movie QUOTATION_MARKWhat Lies BeneathQUOTATION_MARK? It is a great movie in which a scientist believes her lakehouse is haunted, or that she is crazy. <|endoftext|> oh that sound really cool. I'd be happy to take that recommendation and check it out <|endoftext|> That sounds great, I hope it fulfills your movie loving needs and you enjoy! <|endoftext|> i do too! <|endoftext|> Awesome, QUOTATION_MARKWhat Lies BeneathQUOTATION_MARK is my official recommendation! <|endoftext|> thank you for helping me out with this! <|endoftext|> No problem, keep the covers and the popcorn near by, and watch in the dark if you dare! <|endoftext|> Will do! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi How are you today? I'm here to help you pick the perfect movie! <|endoftext|> Hi! Awesome, thanks! I just saw the new movie QUOTATION_MARKA Day in the NeighborhoodQUOTATION_MARK and didn't like it that much.

How was Tom Hanks? <|endoftext|> yes it was, Tom Hanks played the part great though. I just liked him better in other movies <|endoftext|> ok... do you prefer action , movies? There are some good ones coming out in theaters very soon <|endoftext|> yes I do <|endoftext|> Are you familiar with the Kingsmen  Series? <|endoftext|> no I am not <|endoftext|> think James Bond  John Wick style with a bit of humor as well <|endoftext|> Oh I think I would like that! <|endoftext|> So I would point you to the original one... that came out in 2014 Kingsman:  The Secret Service  and if you like  maybe watch the sequel and then head to theaters early next year to see the third <|endoftext|> ok I accept! <|endoftext|> Wonderful  ! <|endoftext|> I think id really enjoy that! <|endoftext|> awesome  I'm glad I could help <|endoftext|> yes thanks so much! <|endoftext|> Ok  I hope you have a good rest of your weekend <|endoftext|> you as well :) <|endoftext|> good bye <|endoftext|> have a nice day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello!

Would you like a movie that is a similar type of story or would you like a different one? <|endoftext|> I would like to watch different one, more chick flick or romantic comedy, is there any movie you will recommend? <|endoftext|> Absolutely. <|endoftext|> nice, what movie would you recommend? <|endoftext|> I have this movie that came out just this year in 2019. It is a romantic comedy and chick flick combined, honestly. The actors are Rebel Wilson and Liam Hemsworth. It has a romance, but is also a comedy because its about a young woman who finds herself trapped inside a romantic comedy. Does this sound like something you'd like to see? <|endoftext|> I love Liam Hemsworth a lot, and as it combines both romance and comedy, I guess I would love to watch it. <|endoftext|> Fantastic!

Awesome movie! <|endoftext|> No I haven't, is that the one with QUOTATION_MARKThe Rock?QUOTATION_MARK I thought he is pretty funny in Jumanji, I heard there's a new one of those coming out too. <|endoftext|> Yes He was in Jumanji <|endoftext|> What is  Hobb's and Shaw about? <|endoftext|> It is a new Fast and Furious Movie with only Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham  pairing up together <|endoftext|> I have seen the fast and the furious movies, they were pretty good. The only one I didn't care for was Tokyo drift. Are there nice cars in Hobbs and Shaw? <|endoftext|> Yes there is! But for me personally The new Jumanji the Next Level movie was great! <|endoftext|> I'm looking forward to the new Jumanji, Kevin Hart is very funny. <|endoftext|> Yes he is! I really like Kevin. Would you be interested in seeing a movie trailer of the new Jumanji? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would like to see the trailer for the new Jumanji, I'm curious who else is in it. <|endoftext|> Great! The cast includes The Rock, Kevin Hart, Jack Black, Nick Jonas, Danny Devito, Danny Glover just to name a few! So do you like this recommendation? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I would like to see the trailer. Jack Black and Danny DeVito are also very funny in other movies I've seen. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you <|endoftext|> HI! I like horror films that are intellegent. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Midnight Cowboy <|endoftext|> What did you like most about that movie? <|endoftext|> I love the cinematography anf director style of movies that are from the late 60s and early 70s <|endoftext|> Your wanting to know more about horror films? <|endoftext|> Yes, i would like that <|endoftext|> Have you heard or seen the trailer for QUOTATION_MARKA Quiet PlaceQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> No I have not <|endoftext|> how about the purge i can send you a trailer to watch <|endoftext|> I've seen the Purge. <|endoftext|> How about The Boy, have you seen that <|endoftext|> No. I would like to see that Trailer <|endoftext|> Its about an American nanny that the family's boy is actually a life sized doll. After some disturbing events she begins to believe the doll is real <|endoftext|> Ok that sounds good. I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|> So you would like to watch the movie trailer <|endoftext|> no thank you. I think i will just rent the movie. Thank you for your time! <|endoftext|> Thank you , have a good time <|endoftext|> Thank you. I really apprecuiate yourt help <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well! How are you? <|endoftext|> I am great just watching tv...  Seen any good Movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes! I recently watched Wonder. I love a good feel-good movie. <|endoftext|> I agree!! What was your favorite part? <|endoftext|> It's hard to pick just one part. I loved the whole thing! It was funny at times, but also made you consider other people's emotions. <|endoftext|> As a parent I really connected to Julia Roberts, and he love and worry all at the same time. <|endoftext|> Yes, I loved her acting in this movie. I'm a big Julia Roberts fan. <|endoftext|> What other Julia Roberts movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I liked her in Ocean's 11, and Runaway Bride, but Erin Brokovich is probably my favorite of hers. <|endoftext|> You should see Pretty Woman if you haven't, to see her in the olden days. <|endoftext|> I honestly have never seen Pretty Women. Thanks for the recommendation, I'd like to see that! <|endoftext|> It is funny to see her when she first started her career <|endoftext|> I'll bet! I love to watch favorite celebrities in their older roles. Thanks so much for your help! <|endoftext|> Not a problem. It also has Richard Gere in it, and a young Jason Alexander <|endoftext|> I didn't realize Jason Alexander was in Pretty Women! He's been in everything! <|endoftext|> He has! But yes he actually plays a guy you love to hate! <|endoftext|> He was in an old made-for-tv version of Cinderella with Brandy. But I know him best from Seinfeld. <|endoftext|> Well he is not funny, not nice or anything in this Pretty woman! He is slimy! <|endoftext|> Oh no! I may not recover from seeing him in that role! haha <|endoftext|> Seriously! It is shocing <|endoftext|> haha Well thanks again for the recommendation of Pretty Women. I will definitely have to watch it now! Even with a slimy Jason Alexander! <|endoftext|> You are very welcome! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> what types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Horror. How about you? <|endoftext|> I like comedy movies. What movie did you see last? <|endoftext|> Frozen 2 <|endoftext|> Do you prefer horror to kid's movies? <|endoftext|> I do. I watched it because I like both. What movies have you seen recently? <|endoftext|> A star is bornn <|endoftext|> I love that movie! Gaga and Cooper are amazing! What was your favorite part? <|endoftext|> Probably when Gaga's character quits her job and decides to sing full time <|endoftext|> yeah, that was pretty awesome! What movies are you looking forward to seeing soon? <|endoftext|> Probably Frozen 2 <|endoftext|> It was really good. Did you see the first frozen? <|endoftext|> Yes I did. <|endoftext|> Who is your favorite character in Frozen? <|endoftext|> Probably Elsa <|endoftext|> Mine too. What is your favorite comedy movie? <|endoftext|> Probably 13 going on 30 <|endoftext|> Oh, that one is cute! Is that with Jennifer Garner? <|endoftext|> Yes, I highly recommend it. <|endoftext|> Yeah, super cute. Have a good day! <|endoftext|> For the horror movie I recommend, it is get out <|endoftext|> I'll have to check it out soon... I have been wanting to see it. Thanks for the talk on movies <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! I'm here to assist you with finding a movie! <|endoftext|> Awesome. How are you doing? <|endoftext|> Pretty good, can't complain! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Doing fine. My first task here. Just living my life best I can. <|endoftext|> That's great to hear! I love it, I'm trying to do that as well for the new year. What was the last movie you have watched? <|endoftext|> A series actually. Rocky, watched all of them just because I enjoy rewatching them. <|endoftext|> Oh, that's very nice! Sylvester Stallone is an amazing actor. Is action your favorite type of genre for movies? <|endoftext|> Not necessarily, though I do enjoy it. I'd say romantic comedy is my favorite next to scifi. <|endoftext|> Sweet, I'm more of a rom-com kind of person as well. Would you like to watch a movie that is a romantic comedy? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I'll definitely be willing to hear your recommendation(s). <|endoftext|> To All the Boys I Loved Before is a very sweet film with some cute comedy involved. It's a Netflix original that will have your heart melted and also, tears from laughing so much. I remember watching this with my partner and it really was enjoyable for the two of us. In addition, Noah Centineo is an upcoming actor himself. I've been seeing him in a couple of shows and movies after watching this one! <|endoftext|> That sounds like it would be up my alley. Thank you for taking the time out to explain what the movie is about and your recommendation. I will most definitely be checking it out! <|endoftext|> Awesome to hear! <|endoftext|> Any other movies I should check out? <|endoftext|> Another movie to definitely check out is, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. It is a bit older than the first one I recommended, however, it is star-studded with Zac Efron and Adam Devine. It's almost a given that it will be another great movie to watch as Zac Efron steals hearts and Adam Devine has a huge comedian side to him. Super cute and funny to watch! <|endoftext|> That's not too old. People give Zac Efron a lot of flack, but I think he's usually a good fit for a comedy. <|endoftext|> Right? I agree as well, he actually is a versatile actor. I know Zac Efron is a great actor in most of the romantic comedies he's in. But he also shows multiple sides to him in some of his action and suspenseful movies. I think Zac Efron is underrated for the wrong reasons. <|endoftext|> I've seen Adam Devine in QUOTATION_MARKWhy Him?QUOTATION_MARK which honestly was one of the funniest movies I've seen. <|endoftext|> That movie was pretty hilarious! That's another star-studded film. One of my favorite actors is Bryan Cranston. If you enjoyed that one with Adam Devine, you will certainly enjoy Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates! <|endoftext|> Definitely checking that out. Wouldn't mind a laugh or two right now. Thanks again for the recommendations! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> I am good, how are you? <|endoftext|> enjoying a quiet day. <|endoftext|> Oh cool. So what's your favorite movie? <|endoftext|> probably ronin, how about you? <|endoftext|> I think my favorite movie would be Catch Me If You Can. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> no what's it about? <|endoftext|> The main character (Leonardo DiCaprio) master of deception, he was also a brilliant forger, whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame: At the age of 17, Frank Abagnale, Jr. became the most successful bank robber in the history of the U.S. FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) makes it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank is always one step ahead of him. <|endoftext|> sounds interesting, I might check it out, have you watch any recent good films? <|endoftext|> Recent ones, I have seen Get Out and Us, have you seen either of those? They're horror films, directed by Jordan Peele <|endoftext|> have you seen get out? <|endoftext|> Yes; I was about to describe it! <|endoftext|> how about split <|endoftext|> I have not actually, i really want to though! What is it about? <|endoftext|> its about three girls who get kidnapped by a man with 23 personalities, and they must some how escape <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting! I definitely need to watch it! Sounds just like my genre of movies I like! What's your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> probably thriller, <|endoftext|> Gotcha. Well cool. I'd say I agree with myself on that too! <|endoftext|> I saw once upon time in Hollywood recently that was good and interesting <|endoftext|> Ohh yes that's a great movie! I love watching movies with Leonardo! He's a great actor! <|endoftext|> he is very talented <|endoftext|> Very, well thank you for your recommendations! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi! Could you recommend a movie to me? <|endoftext|> Yup! First what kind of movies do you like? Action, drama, superhero, etc... <|endoftext|> I really like suspense and drama movies. The last great suspense movie I saw was Parasite. It was a really great blend of dark comedy, suspense and drama. <|endoftext|> Really! everyone i know has been recommending me that movie. I just haven't watched the trailer plus I don't know what is about. <|endoftext|> It's a fantastic film about aspiration, greed and the perception of power in the world. It's a Korean language film, and was the first foreign film in history to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. <|endoftext|> Now i want to watch it! Since you like suspenseful movies, I recommend watching Doctor Sleep. The film is dark but has funny aspects to it. Plus its the sequel the original, The Shining. <|endoftext|> I'm a big fan of Steven King and I loved The Shining. Thank you! I'll definitely watch it. <|endoftext|> Yup! I love his movies. If you have Netflix definetely watch, In the Tall Grass. It's super trippy and keeps you guessing even after the film is over. I had to look up YouTube videos that explained the movie. LOL <|endoftext|> I'll check that one out, too. Thanks again! <|endoftext|> No problem. I'm a huge movie person. I like almost all genres except gruesome horror like the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw. I can't handle those. I like thriller more just because it keeps you thinking. Since you like suspense i also recommend watching Split. <|endoftext|> I just watched Split recently! I like James McAvoy and I really like that trilogy of films with Unbreakable and Glass. I don't really like any of the Saw films or Texas Chainsaw films, either. I'm more of a fan of psychological thrillers. <|endoftext|> That trilogy was really good. i think it took the director 10 plus years to make the sequel for Unbreakable. Honestly, I'm glad Split came out later because the technology they had back in the day did not do movies justice compared to now. <|endoftext|> That's so true. I think it there are so many movies that could have benefited from the graphics technology these days. But sometimes, I think movies like Star Wars rely too much on the graphics and don't put enough emphasis on the story and character development and interaction. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the latest Star Wars trilogy, and that's sad because I'm a huge Star Wars fan. <|endoftext|> YES!! To be honest though, I like more and more movies coming out don't have enough originality. So movie company rather throw in an explosion or two just to make the more captivating. <|endoftext|> I totally agree. I really appreciate action movies that have a great plot and character development. <|endoftext|> Sorry for my lack of words the last comment. I reread what I typed and it made no sense. Yes, action movies are great but almost all the actions movies that are released are comic book based or unoriginal. I have yet to see a movie that's  not based on a book or a documentary of some kind. <|endoftext|> That's true. Maybe because they're the easiest to merchandise. I feel like that's a big consideration of production companies these days. One original action movie that I saw recently was another Korean film called The Man From Nowhere. There's a great sub-genre of Korean action films that just focus on revenge. Do you know any other films like that? <|endoftext|> No, I don't know any films like that. I usually don't watch foreign films, mostly because of the subtitles. Although, all the films you've been recommending seem super interesting. <|endoftext|> All of the films you recommended seem great, too. I'll be sure to watch them. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. What is the latest movie you have watched? <|endoftext|> I watched Frozen 2 last week! <|endoftext|> Wonderful! Now, do you want something similar or to switch it up? <|endoftext|> I want to switch it up, but would like a comedy <|endoftext|> Understood! I think there are some great options available for you. Are you excited? <|endoftext|> Very excited <|endoftext|> I think you should consider Knives Out, starring Jamie Lee Curtis. It is a comedy thriller with lots of twists & turns! <|endoftext|> That sounds like something I would watch! <|endoftext|> Excellent! Let's set you up to see the trailer. <|endoftext|> I would love to see the trailer <|endoftext|> Okay, great! I think you are going to enjoy it. While I set that up, can you tell me do you watch a lot of movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I go to the movie theater once or twice per week <|endoftext|> Would you say comedy is generally your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Typically it is my favorite, thrillers are my second favorite <|endoftext|> Any favorite actors/actresses you love to see? <|endoftext|> The Rock, Ryan Reynolds <|endoftext|> Do you usually watch trailers before heading to the theater? <|endoftext|> Yes i watch some online <|endoftext|> You are an informed consumer, I love it! <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation of Knives Out and will watch the trailer <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I would like to help you find a movie trailer to watch. <|endoftext|> yes..pls <|endoftext|> What genre of movies do you most like to watch? <|endoftext|> Action movies <|endoftext|> Awesome. What was the most recent movie you saw? Did you like it? <|endoftext|> Terminator Dark fate <|endoftext|> Cool. I like action movies too! What did you like about that Terminator movie? <|endoftext|> speed of the movie... <|endoftext|> Yeah, I don't like when movies are too slow. What is your favorite action movie of all time? <|endoftext|> Fast and furious <|endoftext|> I love those movies too. The speed and the cars are great. Let's see if we can find you a good trailer to watch. <|endoftext|> yes..pls..im ready.. <|endoftext|> Do you also like superhero movies? <|endoftext|> yes..i like somuch... <|endoftext|> Okay. I think you should check out the Aquaman trailer then. Does that sound like something you would like? <|endoftext|> ok...im ready to watch <|endoftext|> I've seen the movie and I can definitely recommend seeing that and many of the other DC comics movies. Have you seen Batman vs Superman? <|endoftext|> No...i haven't seen <|endoftext|> What about Justice League? <|endoftext|> No..i haven't seen that too <|endoftext|> Okay. If you watch Batman vs Superman you get some good background on Batman, but you don't have to watch it to get Aquaman. Justice League gives a good intro to the Aquaman character, but again, you don't have to see it to enjoy Aquaman. I just think his parts in the movie are hilarious and give you a feel for the character. <|endoftext|> hmm....im very eager to watch <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! What kind of movies do you enjoy watching? <|endoftext|> I like to watch romantic comedies. <|endoftext|> Oh thats great, I do too! Have you seen QUOTATION_MARKTo All The Boys I've Loved BeforeQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> No, I don't think I have seen this movie before. Can you tell me a little bit about it? Maybe who is in it and the plot. <|endoftext|> The plot is basically a girls love letters shes written to her past loves are exposed. It sort of came out of nowhere and the sequel is coming out soon! <|endoftext|> Oh okay, sounds like a very interesting plot. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Well the sequel looks great so I think you will also like the original! <|endoftext|> Thanks for that recommendation, I will definitely check it out! Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yes! A new movie called The Lovebirds! In this a couple basically are accidentally involved in a murder and are trying to solve it to clear their name. <|endoftext|> Wow, what a plot twist! That one sounds very interesting as well. Do you know who stars in this movie? <|endoftext|> Yes that has Kumail Nanjiani and Issa Rae! <|endoftext|> Okay, I am not very familiar with those two actors. So, I may have to reject this recommendation. <|endoftext|> Gotcha, theres also a movie called The Prom, it has Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, James Corden, Ariana DeBose, Kerry Washington, Andrew Rannells, and Awkwafina! <|endoftext|> What is the plot of this movie? <|endoftext|> Well actually maybe thats not great, its more of a musical, how about The Office Mixup? A woman pretends to be a corporate executive after a case of mistaken identity at her workplace. <|endoftext|> No, I think I will have to reject that recommendation. <|endoftext|> Ok,there is a movie called QUOTATION_MARKIsn't It RomanticQUOTATION_MARK with Rebel Wilson, Natalie is a New York architect who works hard to get noticed at her job, but is more likely to deliver coffee and bagels than design the city's next skyscraper. Things go from bad to weird when she gets knocked unconscious during a subway mugging and magically wakes up to find herself in an alternate universe. Always cynical about love, Natalie's worst nightmare soon comes true when she suddenly discovers that she's playing the leading lady in a real-life romantic comedy. <|endoftext|> Oh, yes, I believe I have heard of this one. This one sounds okay. So I will accept this recommendation. <|endoftext|> Oh great, it definitely looks great and Rebel Wilson is always funny! <|endoftext|> Yes, she is very funny. Do you have anymore that you could recommend? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! I hear you're a big fan of movies <|endoftext|> I am! My husband and I enjoy watching together - usually action-based. Inside that genre, we're pretty open though - thriller, comedy, sci-fi - we enjoy most movies that move fast and keep us on our toes. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Action movies are my favorite genre as well. What was the last action movie you saw in theaters? <|endoftext|> Super hero something...I don't quite recall. We usually watch at home since we have a son on the spectrum and a huge TV to accommodate our movie enjoyment. <|endoftext|> Yeah I know what you mean. Getting out to the movies is tough with kids. Have you seen the new Bad Boys movie with Will Smith? <|endoftext|> No. I enjoyed the first one though. It should be entertaining. I like most of Will Smith's work. <|endoftext|> If you liked the first one, I would definitely recommend watching the new one. I think it was as good as the first and better than the second. Fast paced action and, of course, lots of explosions. <|endoftext|> Of course - lol! What do you think of the new Black Widow movie coming out? I know my hubby is really looking forward to that one! <|endoftext|> I've enjoyed all the Marvel movies. Plus it's about time Scarlett Johansson got her own super hero movie. But since it is not due out for a couple of months would you be interested in watching a trailer for Bad Boys for Life? <|endoftext|> Are there any other super hero movies out now? We may catch Bad Boys for Life at home sometime, but the Marvel movies tend to have more depth, some unexpected plot twists or character shifts. Bad Boys is pretty straightforward, and while it's a fun trip, it's one we probably won't pay to see in theatres. <|endoftext|> There aren't many superhero movies out right now, but you might enjoy Birds of Prey. It's a comic book based movie starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. These aren't Marvel movies but most people that enjoy the Marvel series enjoy these as well. Would you like to see a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure. She was an interesting character. I'd like to know more. <|endoftext|> Well, I wasn't able to find the movie trailer for Birds of Prey but I've selected the Suicide Squad trailer for you to watch. It has the main character of Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn, in it as well. It should give you a good idea of what to expect with the new movie. Does that work for you? <|endoftext|> Yes. I accept. Show me the trailer. <|endoftext|> Perfect. Here's a little background information on the trailer:  secret government agency recruits some of the most dangerous incarcerated super-villains to form a defensive task force. Their first mission: save the world from the apocalypse. <|endoftext|> Sounds entertaining. Anything else you can recommend if we need a back-up plan (we live in a college town, and sometimes movies get sold out quickly.) <|endoftext|> If you're a fan of Guy Ritchie movies, such as Snatch or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, I would recommend going to see his latest movie, The Gentlemen. Also an action movie with great dialogue and some comedic relief. Have you ever seen any of this director's movies? <|endoftext|> Accepted! That sounds even better! Can you show me a trailer for The Gentlemen? <|endoftext|> I can here's a little about the plot: A very British drug lord tries to sell off his highly profitable empire to a dynasty of Oklahoma billionaires. And the actors are: Matthew McConaughey, Charlie Hunnam, Michelle Dockery, Jeremy Strong. Sound good? <|endoftext|> Yes. Matthew McConaughey is usually good for a laugh if nothing else. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi ho, you're looking for a movie? <|endoftext|> Yes I am <|endoftext|> What's something you enjoyed recently? <|endoftext|> I enjoy thriller or mystery movies <|endoftext|> I've enjoyed Christopher Nolan thrillers; what do you like about mysteries <|endoftext|> Oh nice he's the guy that made the batman movies right? I just like not knowing what is about to happen and then having to rewatch the movie so I can find out if I could have solved the mystery the first time watching it <|endoftext|> Yes, he made the Dark Knight films and some thriller/mystery types like QUOTATION_MARKMementoQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKInceptionQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Oh nice yea he's a great director. He made my favorite batman movies; way better than those 90's movies and or the Ben Affleck batman movies <|endoftext|> Have you seen QUOTATION_MARKMementoQUOTATION_MARK or QUOTATION_MARKInceptionQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I have seen Inception; I love Leo Dicarpio. I think he's a great actor. I have no seen Memento <|endoftext|> You should def see QUOTATION_MARKMementoQUOTATION_MARK; synopsis: A man with short-term memory loss attempts to track down his wife's murderer. <|endoftext|> Oh man, that sounds great. I will defintely have to check it out. Who is in it? <|endoftext|> Umm, Guy Pearce, Carrie-Ann Moss... It's from 2000. Lesser known actors and an independent feel <|endoftext|> Wow nice; thank you for the recommendation. I do like Guy Pearce <|endoftext|> It's classified as mystery/thriller, too. What else did you like him in? <|endoftext|> I liked him in Iron Man 3, Bedtime Stories, the Hurt Locker <|endoftext|> I forgot about Hurt Locker, that's cool. Memento definitely requires multiple viewings, too <|endoftext|> Why do you say that? Is it that good or I won't get it the first time? <|endoftext|> By the time you start putting it all together you've somewhat forgotten the earlier events that are crucial <|endoftext|> Yea for sure; I understand your thought process behind it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, great day to you. <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> So what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I watch a lot of action movies. My favorites are superhero movies and scary films. Do you have any specific recommendation within these two genres? <|endoftext|> Hm. So you like scary films? I may have some recommendations for you. <|endoftext|> What are your favorite scary films so far? <|endoftext|> My scary films so far would have to be the major franchises like halloween, scream, nightmare on elm street. Things like that. What are your favorites. <|endoftext|> I enjoy Stephen King based movies like It, It Chapter 2, or even Stranger Things <|endoftext|> Do you prefer the older Stephen King's It, or would you prefer the new Stephen King's IT <|endoftext|> The new Stephen King's IT <|endoftext|> I think I may have a new movie that I think you may enjoy. if you like Stephen King's it, then I believe that you would be interested in this new movie. Its called Black Christmas, have you heard about it yet? <|endoftext|> I have heard about Black Christmas. Why do you think I would like it? <|endoftext|> I think you would like it because it takes Christmas to a whole new level and brings a bit of horror with it. Its about a group of students that are stalked by a person during their christmas break. <|endoftext|> Sounds like a very good movie for the occasion since my Christmas break is coming up soon. I like watching movies or shows during certain seasons. I think this movie will be a great option over Christmas. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Yeah I'm the same when it comes to watching movies or shows during a certain season. I'm glad you liked my recommendation because I for one love when movies switch up themes and get excited, and makes me want to watch it. <|endoftext|> Do you have any other movies in mind? <|endoftext|> So I remember you saying that you loved superhero movies, have you happened to have seen the newest Avengers? Avengers: Endgame? <|endoftext|> No I haven't but I've heard great reviews about it. I forgot about it but now that you've reminded me, I plan on watching that soon when I have more free time. <|endoftext|> It's a great one if you love superhero movies. Lots of great returning cast, and a few new ones really set the movie apart from the rest. I really enjoyed it myself considering its not my favorite genre of movies, but all in all i really did enjoy it, and I know you will. <|endoftext|> Thanks for all of the recommendations. I accept all of them. I will be looking forward to watching these movies over my break soon! <|endoftext|> That is so wonderful, have a wonderful day and happy holidays. I know you will love both of those movies. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer you'd like. <|endoftext|> very like <|endoftext|> What type of movies are you interested in? <|endoftext|> very interesting <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like to go see? <|endoftext|> the long king <|endoftext|> Do you want to see an animated movie or a live version movie? <|endoftext|> very improvement <|endoftext|> I'd recommend the live version of Aladdin. The story remains true to the original cartoon version. The cast is great it's fun to see an old movie in a new way.

He's like a more handsome and more muscular Brue Willis. ahah <|endoftext|> Oh I agree would love to see that movie again <|endoftext|> yea. The rock has been killer it lately. Who would have known he would become this famous! <|endoftext|> Oh I agree, he really did a great job in Jumanji also. I like Nick Jonas also <|endoftext|> yup.

I am here to give you some recommendations! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am good. Thanks for asking. How are you? <|endoftext|> I am good! Have you seen any movies recently in the theaters? <|endoftext|> Yes, I'm looking for a movie trailer recommendation. The recent film I saw in theaters was Web of Death. <|endoftext|> Oh, so you like horror genres? <|endoftext|> It's a fantasy martial arts film with some spooky elements. <|endoftext|> What kind of genre are you interested in? <|endoftext|> Something fun. I enjoy comedies. <|endoftext|> Have you hear about QUOTATION_MARKThe King's ManQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> It hasn't been on my radar. I enjoy Matthew Vaughn's films. <|endoftext|> He is the one who made QUOTATION_MARKThe King's ManQUOTATION_MARK and it is honestly really good. <|endoftext|> That sounds great! <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would like to see that trailer. Thanks. <|endoftext|> No problem! <|endoftext|> That's all. Thank you very much for you help. <|endoftext|> The movie is about a war to wipe out millions and one man must race against time to stop them. <|endoftext|> Sounds like exciting stuff. I also like the period setting. Very pleased with the selection. <|endoftext|> Yes! And it is a wonderful plot with criminal masterminds. I can't wait for it to get out. <|endoftext|> Should be thrilling. I look forward to watching it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! I'm Kari! <|endoftext|> HI <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you like to watch in your free time? <|endoftext|> All kinds of movies, usually something interesting <|endoftext|> Oooh I like something that holds my interests, sounds like you like a bit of mystery? <|endoftext|> mystery can be good, I like indie stuff, anything by wes anderson <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Grand Budapest Hotel? <|endoftext|> sure, thats a really good one, I still think Rushmores my favorite <|endoftext|> Rushmore was so good! Did you know it won a Film Critics award? <|endoftext|> im not surprised, wes tells storys that are messed up but thats where the comedy comes from <|endoftext|> I think you should watch The Monuments Men, it is so great and also features Bill Murray just like Rushmore! <|endoftext|> That was a pretty good movie, little slow though. <|endoftext|> You should give it another shot <|endoftext|> I will have to do that <|endoftext|> I watched it in a film history class for my major and it was quite possibly the best movie to write a report on! <|endoftext|> sometimes when you watch a movie again it has a different affect on you <|endoftext|> I completely agree! I recently gave it a second chance and it made the world of a difference <|endoftext|> I agree I will watch your recommendation <|endoftext|> Awesome! I think you will see it from a whole new perspective. <|endoftext|> have a good day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there...how you doing today? <|endoftext|> I am doing very well, how are you? <|endoftext|> Better then I deserve...so movies huh <|endoftext|> Yes, I like action movies, have you seen any lately that are good? <|endoftext|> You bet...I am a fan of Marvel aka Superheros...you? <|endoftext|> I like those as well, is there any new ones that are good? I haven't seen a good one in a while so I'm looking for a recommendation. <|endoftext|> My recent was Jumanji (not Marvel) & has a ton of action/adventure - was fun. <|endoftext|> oh yes, I love the Rock and Kevin Hart, they make marvelous movies. <|endoftext|> Me too...great QUOTATION_MARKchemistryQUOTATION_MARK there ;) alright it was nice chatting - my best wishes <|endoftext|> Thank you, I accept your recommendation. You as well. <|endoftext|> Bye now...Go Movies! <|endoftext|> Yes, I love movies! <|endoftext|> Do you've any fave actor/movie? <|endoftext|> I really like the Fast and the Furious movies, I have watched them since I was young <|endoftext|> Oh me too...they're great...excited for the upcoming? <|endoftext|> Yes, I heard they are bringing Paul Walker's brother in but I'm not sure <|endoftext|> IDK...F9's cast is awesome...big stars <|endoftext|> Yes, How did you feel about Hobbs and Shaw? <|endoftext|> It was good...odd pairing...but action was over the top. <|endoftext|> I think I might go watch it now, thanks so much! <|endoftext|> You bet...Thanks again. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! How are you doing? <|endoftext|> Not too bad, how about yourself? <|endoftext|> Pretty good! I hear you're looking for a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> You heard correctly. <|endoftext|> Great! You're in luck as I am a movie geek. What kind of genres do you prefer to watch? <|endoftext|> Word is bond. I guess recently I've been trying to find a good horror movie, but haven't had much luck. <|endoftext|> Gotcha. What was the last horror movie you saw? What'd you think of it? <|endoftext|> Last one was this cheap found footage movie called Helll house LLC. Defintely exceeded my expectations, especially with the budget constraints. <|endoftext|> Oh nice! I saw a lot of people buzzing about that one since it's been on Amazon Prime. Found footage is hard to do well, I'm glad this one was good. Did you see Get Out or Us at all? Peele's been making waves in the horror scene and would like to hear your opinion on the films if you've seen them <|endoftext|> I somehow keep managing to forget to watch both of those. Is there one that you'd recommend above the other? <|endoftext|> Get Outs plot is way stronger but Lupita Nyongo's performance in Us is superb and terrifying. If you're looking to be more scared I'd recommend Us. <|endoftext|> A strong plot is definitely important. I think I'll go with Get Out and follow with Us if I like the former. <|endoftext|> Awesome. The plot to Get Out is superb and once your done definitely check out an interview with Peele, there are so many hidden double meanings and symbols. Its not jump-scare-y but definitely unnerving and well done. Definitely worth watching <|endoftext|> I like the psychological stuff for sure. I've always liked Peele, thought he was the funniest of those two for sure. Glad to see him working in films. <|endoftext|> Me too, that guy is so smart, I'm glad he's getting the recognition he deserves. Do you accept that recommendation or would you like another one? <|endoftext|> I definitely accept that one, gave me the extra push to finally watch it. <|endoftext|> Neat! Happy to help. I'll grab that trailer for ya. A fun last bit for you- look up the meaning of the fruit loops scene. That's what I'll leave ya with <|endoftext|> Thank you, I'll check that out. <|endoftext|> Have a great night <|endoftext|> You as well. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to recommend a movie trailer to you! <|endoftext|> Sounds good! I Like crime and suspense thrillers. Like Quentin Terintino or Guy Ritchie <|endoftext|> Ok great! I was just going to ask what types of movies you enjoy. What is the latest movie that you saw? <|endoftext|> The Ballad of Buster Scruggs <|endoftext|> Oh I recently watched that on Netflix! That is a Coen Brothers film. Do you generally like movies by the Coen Brothers? <|endoftext|> Yes, They are good movies <|endoftext|> One of my favorite Coen Brothers films is Miller's Crossing. It seems lesser known than their other movies. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> I have not, I will have to look in to it <|endoftext|> I think the movie highlights the Coen Brother's ability to make a compelling movie even toward the beginning of their carreer. It also stars John Turturro who has been in many of their movies since. <|endoftext|> That's an acceptable reccomendation. Any other Cohen movies you could reccommend? <|endoftext|> Absolutely! Barton Fink, Raising Arizona and O Brother Where Art Thou? all come to mind. <|endoftext|> Raising Arizona and O brother where art thou are classics, Barto Fink I have not seen yet... <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer for Miller's Crossing? <|endoftext|> yes please I would like to see the trsiler <|endoftext|> Alright - I'm going to send it over now. <|endoftext|> Okay, whenever you are ready <|endoftext|> Ok I have selected Miller's Crossing. I will try to send Barton Fink as well if I can. <|endoftext|> Okay, whwnever you are ready <|endoftext|> Did you get the trailer yet? <|endoftext|> I have not received any links yet, no. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great! What's the latest movie you've watched? <|endoftext|> Frozen 2, you? <|endoftext|> 1917! What stuff did you like in Frozen 2 and what stuff didn't you like? <|endoftext|> I like the animation and the comedy, I like nice looking movies. I didn't like the weak story. <|endoftext|> Are animated movies a big draw for you? <|endoftext|> I think so, I like animation as a medium form. <|endoftext|> Are there any particular voice actors that you like in animated movies, or is it more just about the quality of the story? <|endoftext|> I think it's more about the quality to me, I don't care much about who's in a movie. <|endoftext|> Do you like rewatching old animation movies sometimes for fun? Or only the newest ones? <|endoftext|> I love the older ones, the newer ones aren't as good. <|endoftext|> If you like going back and watching older classics, I would recommend that you rewatch Beauty and the Beast! It's funny while still having a strong and endearing story. <|endoftext|> I do like that movie, It's not my favorite but I still think it's one of the best! <|endoftext|> It's really great! Which one is your favorite of the Disney films? <|endoftext|> Lost Kingdom of Atlantis. It's a cult classic. <|endoftext|> Oh yes! I remember watching that one in theaters as a kid. <|endoftext|> I never got to see it in theaters, but I still think it was robbed of it's popularity! It's great! <|endoftext|> I remember being very excited to see it, the marketing build up for it was huge that summer. It's sad that it didn't get the reception it deserved. <|endoftext|> I agree, thanks for your recommendation though! It's also good. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer is there any movies you'd like to see the trailers of ? <|endoftext|> I want to see a movie that is full of twists and turns and more about the plot than relationships or sex <|endoftext|> hmm what about Carrie (1976) the twist ending in this movie is both impossible and too terrifying to forget. <|endoftext|> Carrie is good, but I want something with more of a twist like QUOTATION_MARKthe villageQUOTATION_MARK or QUOTATION_MARKthe uninvitedQUOTATION_MARK I want something that is scary, but not all blood and gore, but more mind blowing, like... wow didn't think that would happen. <|endoftext|> can i recommend maybe geralds game its not a blood & gore movie more of like a psycological horror thriller suspense. its about a woman who accidentally kills her husband during a kinky game and shes left hand cuffed to the bed and starts seeing strange things figures etc its pretty good movie and i think itll fit what youre looking for <|endoftext|> that sounds good, I accept that suggestion <|endoftext|> alright id like to talk to you more about the movies you like and recommend more before im able to give you that suggestion what do you like about the movie the uninvited i actually loved that movie as well <|endoftext|> the ending was amazing, and every time i watch it with someone new i see new things that point to it. I also like Spanish films that have twists like the orphanage and pan's laborith <|endoftext|> it was i loved that movie oh ive never seen those ill have to take a look at them what did you like about the spanish films and is there any other genres of really love <|endoftext|> psychological thrillers for late nights or mindless days and action movies where it isn't all about naked people but have death and murder and sometimes ridiculous things happen makes it entertaining like john wick <|endoftext|> john wick is a fantastic movie what did you like about that one and ill now send you the trailer for geralds game if you still accept that suggestion its a great film and i think you'd love it ! <|endoftext|> yes i accept <|endoftext|> oh wait a moment can you tell me more of you prefrences im so sorry i just love talking about movies do you like comedy <|endoftext|> comedies aren't as exciting anymore, since the early 2000s and super bad its just been kind of not funny. <|endoftext|> yeah thats true thrillers and horrors are my favorite haha comedies are eh my favorite right now is the new it 1 and 2 oh and geralds game is on netflix which is awesome just thought id let you know <|endoftext|> awesome, thanks! <|endoftext|> oh and another id like to recommend is Us its a really good thriller its one of my favorites as well ! <|endoftext|> oh, i've seen that. very nice film, thanks for the recommendation! Maybe I'll watch it this weekend.:-) <|endoftext|> of course :) thank you for letting me help you :) <|endoftext|> of course, thanks for helping! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi.. I understand you are looking for a movie trailer to watch! <|endoftext|> Yes <|endoftext|> Great. I'd love to help you. What kind of movies do you generally like? <|endoftext|> I love action, comedy and romance movies <|endoftext|> Thats a pretty broad range. Great! What is the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> no bodys fool with Tiffany Haddish <|endoftext|> I love Tiffany Haddish. Did you like that movie? <|endoftext|> yes it was funny <|endoftext|> great. That gives me a godo start to go on <|endoftext|> ok thank you <|endoftext|> I think you might like QUOTATION_MARKIsn't it RomanticQUOTATION_MARK its a combination comedy/romance <|endoftext|> with Rebel I did see that one it was good too <|endoftext|> hmmm ok.. le <|endoftext|> what else would you recommend <|endoftext|> Ok this one is coming out soon -  its called QUOTATION_MARKlike a boss and stars Salma Hayek and Tiffany Haddish.. do you want to hear more about it? <|endoftext|> yes please <|endoftext|> Ok..

Do you think you might want to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> yes i would like to see the trailer <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, How are you today?I would like to help you find a movie trailer to watch. <|endoftext|> Hello. I am fine, thank-you. How are you? I am looking for a good horror movie. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yes. But first I would like to know what is the most recent movie you have seen? <|endoftext|> The Nightmare Before Christmas. <|endoftext|> Oh that's great. What type of movie trailers do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> Pretty much anything to do with horror. <|endoftext|> Splendid. Do you also enjoy comedy horror? <|endoftext|> Not really, no. I don't really like comedy. <|endoftext|> What about gory horror? <|endoftext|> I don't mind gory horror. <|endoftext|> Jeepers Creepers is what I would recommend <|endoftext|> Thank-you so much. <|endoftext|> You are most welcome. <|endoftext|> Do you have any other horror movie recommendations? My favourite horror genre is paranormal horror. <|endoftext|> oh yes indeed. There is a great one regarding a board game. <|endoftext|> A board game? Can you elaborate? <|endoftext|> yes, its a witch board, very famous <|endoftext|> What is the name of the movie? <|endoftext|> Ouija. <|endoftext|> I see. Thanks so much. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I am here to help recommend a movie to you. <|endoftext|> Cool. I'm looking for a good action flick. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Do you have a preference on the branding? <|endoftext|> I don't think so. What is an example of a movie brand? <|endoftext|> Marvel, Terminator, Star Wars...the brand seems like it could be a name, but other products and services are marketed under the brand name <|endoftext|> Well i think I like one-offs more. Brand appear to be more sequel oriented. <|endoftext|> ok, got it <|endoftext|> But I do love the Godfather. <|endoftext|> If you like the Godfather, you may like The Irishman <|endoftext|> The one about Jimmy Hoffa? <|endoftext|> Yes, but more about his friend Frank Sheeran who was a high official in a labor union and hit man who worked with the Bufalino crime family <|endoftext|> I liked the Godfather more for the convo than action. Is this a good conversational movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, not so much action, but more dialogue. Are you familiar with Martin Scorsese movies? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I like Scorsese. <|endoftext|> Ok, this is one of his newest films. In fact it should be noted that Scorsese used a QUOTATION_MARKde-agingQUOTATION_MARK process on the elderly actors in this film that critics are saying may drastically reduce the need for make-up in the future. <|endoftext|> Whoa that cool. I DeNiro in it? He does a lot of Scorsese flicks. <|endoftext|> Yes, DeNiro is the lead, also with Al Pacino and Joe Pesci <|endoftext|> Whoa! DeNiro and Pacino were in the Godfather. All we are missing is Brando. <|endoftext|> Lol! This movie explores Sheeran's relationships with the Bufalino family and with Hoffa. It also explains why he became a hit man and how he became a high official in the labor union. He served in WWII for Italy which is how he learned to kill. <|endoftext|> Well, with the pedigree of acting there, I think I'll give it a shot. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Yep! Happy viewing! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today? <|endoftext|> hello there <|endoftext|> I'm here to help recommend a movie, do you like movies? <|endoftext|> any good comedy? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Office Christmas Party? It's hilarious <|endoftext|> i would love to watch it <|endoftext|> It's got a good blend of raunchy comedy and some action, I bet you would really like it <|endoftext|> what year is that? <|endoftext|> It was made in 2016 <|endoftext|> who stars? <|endoftext|> Jason Bateman, Jennifer Anniston, TJ Miller, Kate McKinnon <|endoftext|> where is the setting? <|endoftext|> In Chicago. BTW, Jennifer Anniston looks super bangable. <|endoftext|> oohh if she plays there i accept the recommendation <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's definitely a solid choice. Plus its seasonal <|endoftext|> any other since we have more turns? <|endoftext|> Not really, just waiting to be done <|endoftext|> yeah me too but we have to finish them,anyway nice talking to you <|endoftext|> Seriously though, its a solid movie. Guaranteed to make you LOL <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> You are welcome <|endoftext|> any good family film? <|endoftext|> Secret Life of Pets 2 <|endoftext|> what year is that and who stars? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> A couple. Honestly, I've been watching a lot of kid movies. I'm thinkin that I should probably watch a more age appropriate movie for myself. <|endoftext|> Ah there's nothing wrong with enjoying a good kid movies! What types of age appropriate movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I really like comedies. Anything with Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd or any other comedian that's really ironic. I really enjoy movies where there is a huge misunderstanding that kind of spirals out of control. Kind of like Pineapple Express or Burn After Reading. Have you seen Burn After Reading? <|endoftext|> Yes I have, and I enjoyed it. Will Ferrell and Paul Rudd are also some of my favorite comedians, along with Jason Bateman. Have you seen any of his movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I really like Horrible Bosses! <|endoftext|> A great movie! Definitely one of those movies that quickly spirals out of control. <|endoftext|> Absolutely, most Jason Bateman movies do kind of like Game Night. <|endoftext|> Would you be interested in a similar movie or something different? <|endoftext|> Something similar would be awesome. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Jay and Silent Bob Reboot? <|endoftext|> I have not. Would I have to see the first movie to understand this one? <|endoftext|> No, and that's the beauty of it. It practically follows the original films plot line. <|endoftext|> I'll have to check it out. Just out of curiousity what was your diffrent recommendation? <|endoftext|> I was going to recommend Toy Story 4, since you have been watching kid movies recently. <|endoftext|> Oh that sounds nice. I was meaning to watch it at the movie but for one reason or another I did not. I think for right now this would be the movie to watch. <|endoftext|> It really is a great movie for anyone, not just kids. Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would. <|endoftext|> Great! You won't be disappointed <|endoftext|> It looks super cute. I appreciate the recommendations. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there. So, what type of movie have you been wanting to see lately? <|endoftext|> I like horror movies, action or thriller types <|endoftext|> Have you seen the new IT movie yet? <|endoftext|> I did, it was very scary, i had to hide during the parts with the clown lol <|endoftext|> Yes, pennywise was highly scary in that movie. What did you think of it? <|endoftext|> I think they did a good job on the remake. I didn't appreciate the Pet Semetary remake quite as much. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen the pet cemetary remake yet. Was it scary? <|endoftext|> It was scary but you can't think of it as the same movie like the book, it's a completely different story <|endoftext|> Well books are usually  better than the movies lol. So, if you had to decide which movie was better, as far as scare tactic goes? IT or pet cemetary? <|endoftext|> I think IT was far more scary and better overall <|endoftext|> I couldn't agree more! <|endoftext|> Have you seen anything recent that was good? I haven't been to the theater since Cap Marvel <|endoftext|> Not lately no. The last movie I saw was john wick 3 <|endoftext|> I hear the john wick movies are good <|endoftext|> Yes they definitely are! <|endoftext|> You can recommend those :P lol <|endoftext|> Yes I highly recommend the john wick 3 movie <|endoftext|> sounds like a good time with popcorn <|endoftext|> Yes it definitely keeps you on your toes <|endoftext|> oh good i like when its hard to predict i usually have it all figured out <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> hello there <|endoftext|> what kind of movies do you like <|endoftext|> I enjoy heart felt movies, do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> the poet book <|endoftext|> Who are the actors in that movie? I am looking for actors who are younger in age <|endoftext|> oh no this movie has older actors perhaps I should recommend another movie <|endoftext|> That would be exceptional. I would like a movie that caters to a younger audience <|endoftext|> how about that movie called QUOTATION_MARKGiant Little OnesQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> Would this cater to teenagers? I need a movie that will cater to a teen demographic if possible <|endoftext|> yes by Josh Wiggins <|endoftext|> Is there any action in that movie at all? <|endoftext|> No its a story line no violence or action <|endoftext|> Could you recommend something that has a bit of action in it? <|endoftext|> Hunt for the wilder People <|endoftext|> Interesting! Is there any sexual scenes in the film? <|endoftext|> There is no sexual scenes <|endoftext|> Who are the actors in the film? <|endoftext|> Sam Neil and Julian Dennison <|endoftext|> what year was it made? <|endoftext|> it was actually 2016 on Hulu how about you can you recommend any mafia movies? <|endoftext|> sure, how about Gotti <|endoftext|> never had of it who's in it <|endoftext|> amazing actor, Jon Travolta. Question about the movie you recommended...What would be the best demographic for that film? <|endoftext|> that movie was acted in canada during winter beautiful snow mountains <|endoftext|> oh interesting. But what age group would you say would be good to see that movie? <|endoftext|> This movie is for 16 and up <|endoftext|> That sounds great! Can you give me a brief summary of the story  line? <|endoftext|> Ricky Baker (Dennison), a juvenile delinquent who was abandoned by his mother, is taken by child welfare services officer Paula and police officer Andy, to live in a remote farm with foster mother Bella and her husband, the cantankerous southern man Hec (Neill). Hec is remote, but Bella quickly manages to break through Ricky's defensive shell by taking him hunting and giving him a dog for his 13th birthday, which he names Tupac after his idol Tupac Shakur. <|endoftext|> oh boy this sounds like a good movie. Have you seen the movie yourself? <|endoftext|> yes about 10 times <|endoftext|> how interesting! If you are looking to check out Gotti, here is a brief summary of the movie: The film will reveal the relationship of a father who lived and died by the mob code and a son who, while brought up to lead a life of crime, chose to leave that world behind and redeem himself and the Gotti name. <|endoftext|> Sounds like a book I read a while ago very interesting i will check it out <|endoftext|> Awesome! And I will certainly check out your recommendation too. I have kids who would find that movie entertaining! Thank you for your recommendation! <|endoftext|> of-course not a problem only thing I found out is that its only available on Hulu <|endoftext|> I have Hulu so it wont be an issue looking it up. Thanks again. <|endoftext|> I found Goti now I can relax tonight and what it <|endoftext|> yes, please. John Travolta is a very profound actor. Any movie he is in, and you cant go wrong <|endoftext|> That is right! Have you watched The Irishman? <|endoftext|> No i haven't, i think i saw the trailer on Netflix! is it good? <|endoftext|> it is very good but very long 3 hrs <|endoftext|> 3 hours is a long time. i see Robert De Niro is in it. He is another amazing actor. Ill have to check that out as well <|endoftext|> they made Robert De Niro and Al Pacino look really young in the movie and they age as the movie continues let me not tell you to much and kill your buzz for the movie <|endoftext|> right right! I love when they take the older actors and use makeup to make the look young again. The make up artists' craft is amazing <|endoftext|> whoever was the make up artist in that movie is a genius <|endoftext|> oh, you have me excited to watch that tonight after school. thank you again for another great movie recc! <|endoftext|> if you have 3 hrs to watch it it will be better unlike me I cut it into 3 series <|endoftext|> I will try to watch it in one sitting. i love movies and like to watch them in their entirety. unless there are some slow parts <|endoftext|> I promise you that movie will keep you glued to your tv like a zombie <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, how it's going? What kind of movies are you into? <|endoftext|> Hi! At the moment I'm on a mob movie kick <|endoftext|> Mob movies? Very specific, but cool! Older ones or new takes on the genre? <|endoftext|> Either/or as long as they're good. Goodfellas is one of my all time favorites <|endoftext|> Do you like it when there is a bit of comedy thrown in or does that ruin it for you? <|endoftext|> No, comedy is good. Actually recently watched The Departed and thought it could have used a bit of comic releif <|endoftext|> Definitely could have! Also recently watched that. Do you have a favorite director? <|endoftext|> In the genre? Not really, big on Tarantino and Wes Anderson but think theyre a bit outside this scope <|endoftext|> An Anderson gangster film would be...an awesome combination in my opinion. Some nice pastels lining the dark alleyways. Anyhow, I think I have a suggestion! Particularly if you like comedy as well and don't mind the QUOTATION_MARKgangsterQUOTATION_MARK side of things being more of a side plot element. <|endoftext|> Ha, at the very least it would be interesting. Lay it on me <|endoftext|> Nice Oscar-winner for ya! But one that many still haven't heard of. In my experience, at least. <|endoftext|> You have piqued my interest. What would be the title of this elusive film? <|endoftext|> Some Like It Hot. <|endoftext|> A real throwback, have heard of it, but never seen. I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|> Awesome! I had an entire month-long intensive course of sorts on Billy Wilder while I was at university. Interesting guy. <|endoftext|> Anything else of his you would recommend in particular? <|endoftext|> The Front Page. He contributed to the Sherlock Holmes canon with a good entry as well... <|endoftext|> Interesting, I'll check it out. What did you study at university? <|endoftext|> Creative Writing BA, Film Studies MA. Currently doing lots of travel and eventually want for one stream of income to be teaching World Cinema courses, even if just at an adjunct level and combined with other income. <|endoftext|> That's awsome! If you could teach on one genre/region of film what would it be? <|endoftext|> Genre = Horror. Region = Asia. I'm all for combining the two in a course if that's not deemed too obscure for whatever institution I teach at. <|endoftext|> There's a spot for every niche. I just watched The Train to Busan, Korean zombie flick. A little standard but still entertaining. Not a buff in the horror genre by any means <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am good thank you.:) <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you typically watch at the movie theater? <|endoftext|> typically high adrenaline types, rambo,f&f, etc, etc <|endoftext|> So you're a big Sylvester Stalone fan. Is that fair to say? <|endoftext|> I wouldn't say a big fan but I do enjoy his movies the older ones were better. <|endoftext|> I agree with you, his older movies were very well made. Who is your favorite actor now? <|endoftext|> I don't have a favorite per say now, most movies are all the same rewashed content, same with the actors really. <|endoftext|> I have good action film for you. How about Hobs & Shaw? <|endoftext|> Yeah That sounds good I accept <|endoftext|> I have another movie for you. Knives Out!!! <|endoftext|> Hmm m that looks pretty good I am done <|endoftext|> It has a very good plot and Daniel Craig has the lead role in this one. <|endoftext|> I just watched the trailer on youtube it looks good with some humor as well i think i might give it a try later thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> You're welcome. Are you a fan of the Avengers series? <|endoftext|> I love the avengers though i secretly watch both universes <|endoftext|> I have the perfect movie for you. Avengers: Endgame!!! <|endoftext|> Ohh yess I accept that one for sure <|endoftext|> I'm glad. I got the trailer for you. <|endoftext|> okay thanks <|endoftext|> It was nice chatting with you today. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> hai <|endoftext|> so tell me what are the latest movies you have been watching <|endoftext|> ok <|endoftext|> i really liked the new movie parasite it was nominated for many acadamy awards <|endoftext|> i alsi like <|endoftext|> that is great to hear it is a original movie with a great story and dialog would you like to see a tralor of the movie parasite <|endoftext|> yes i like <|endoftext|> great ill send you the movie tralier now to parasite im sure you will love it <|endoftext|> yes i am sure iam love in movie <|endoftext|> i hope you enjoy this trailer <|endoftext|> ok i ejoy thr trailor <|endoftext|> on a different note have you heard of the joker movie i also think this will be a classic in the future its very detailing and a good story would you like to see this one? <|endoftext|> yes i have good story  in see <|endoftext|> well if your looking for a unique story that is the one its different from the kid storys and has more of Adult theme <|endoftext|> yes i looking in unique story <|endoftext|> well for my last recomendation would be the new version of cats i seen this show on broadway when i was a child as a play and now they have made it into a movie and the story is amazing check it out <|endoftext|> yes look at the video version <|endoftext|> awsome i hope i was able to help you selcted a movie today out of the one i showed you cats or parasite or joker which would you choose to watch <|endoftext|> awesome i hope <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing? <|endoftext|> I am doing great. How are you? <|endoftext|> I am doing very well. I hope that you're having a good morning. I was wondering what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I really like most movies except horror or overly romantic movies that have a lot of rated R content. Some of my favorites include historical and romantic comedies. <|endoftext|> Oh, wow. That's very similar to the kind of movies that I like to see. Have you seen any movies recently? <|endoftext|> Honestly, I work with children so I saw Frozen 2 with one of them. I also watched the new Aladdin movie a couple of weeks ago. I haven't seen one of my favorite kind in a while though. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Well you mentioned that you enjoy historical movies, and those are ones I know a lot about actually. I used to review them. What is your favorite historical movie? <|endoftext|> I like The Scarlet Pimpernel. That is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! <|endoftext|> That is a classic. I saw that a long time ago. I wasn't sure what you meant by historical, but you meant movies that are more classical? I have some recommendations that are coming to mind. <|endoftext|> I believe that it is also historical because of the time period in which the movie takes place. I do like classic movies too though <|endoftext|> Do you like action at all? I recent movie that I saw was 1917 for example. It recently came out. That one blew me away. <|endoftext|> I do sometimes like action but war movies where the main character dies make me mad. I am willing to hear your thoughts though. <|endoftext|> I agree. I don't like those kind of movies where the main character dies. What about movies with a happy ending? <|endoftext|> I like happy endings...They make me happy haha. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen black panther? It is not classical, but it highlights that the main character can overcome difficulties and has a happy ending haha. <|endoftext|> I have not seen that movie yet. Is it your typical superhero movie? I also forgot to ask what the movie 1917 is about? <|endoftext|> 1917 is a movie where a young man has to send a message to his brother during the great way in 1917. If he doesn't send the message to his brother all of the soldiers with his brother will die. It was very historical and interesting. Black Panther is a unique super hero movie and really interesting. <|endoftext|> I have been interested in watching the Black Panther movie but was a little put off that it was another superhero movie because they have been making so many lately. If it is unique, I would be interested in watching it to see what makes it different. Thank you for the recommendation and I accept it. <|endoftext|> Yes. You should watch the Black Panther trailer. I don't really like super hero movies either, but it was unique because the character isn't a traditional super hero like we see in Spiderman. The movie also had social and historical elements, and is based on Africa. It is really unique and insightful. It isn't like a Captain America movie haha. That's why i'd recommend it. <|endoftext|> Thank you very much! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hello, I am looking for a movie with action. <|endoftext|> Okay, have you seen any lately? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. Been working too much. <|endoftext|> Okay, sorry about that <|endoftext|> Action packed is what I am interested in. <|endoftext|> Action with lots of gore, or just minimal <|endoftext|> Either way is fine with me. <|endoftext|> Okay, let's see what I can come up with <|endoftext|> Great and thank you. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Bad Boys for Life? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. I did see the other Bad Boys <|endoftext|> How much did you like the older parts? <|endoftext|> I loved them. I think I will check out the new one.Thank you for your recommendation I appriciate it. Have a good one. <|endoftext|> I'm pretty sure you will like this <|endoftext|> I'll check it out this evening.. <|endoftext|> Ok, that would be great <|endoftext|> Thank you for your help. <|endoftext|> You're welcome <|endoftext|> Hope you have a great weekend. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. I would like to help you with finding a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> I do. Do you have any particular genre in mind? <|endoftext|> I like sci-fi <|endoftext|> I do too. Are you looking for older or newer sci-fi? <|endoftext|> Either will do. <|endoftext|> Can you tell me about some sci-fi movies you ahve enjoyed? <|endoftext|> Blade Runner, old godzilla movies, Star trek <|endoftext|> That's a good mix. I love Blade Runner. Rutger Hauer is amazing in that. Did you see the sequel? <|endoftext|> I have <|endoftext|> It's very visual. I like it a lot. Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|> Do you have any other suggestions. <|endoftext|> Did you see Ex Machina? <|endoftext|> Yes, any other suggestions <|endoftext|> That director made a movie after that I loved called Annihilation. It's definitely sci-fi. Did you see that one? <|endoftext|> No, I'll check it out. <|endoftext|> Great. Just so you know the plot is about a group of women that enter an area that has popped up called the shimmer. No one that has went in has come back out. Inside dna of the existing nature has twisted and combinjed with each other. It stars Natalie Portman among others. <|endoftext|> Don't tell me. <|endoftext|> It's just a basic plot outline. No spoilers. Would you lie to see this trailer? <|endoftext|> I do <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, my name is John. <|endoftext|> Hi my name is Mel. Do you have any movie recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yes, I am happy to help you find something you would like. Do you like action movies? <|endoftext|> Sometimes as long as there is good character development <|endoftext|> Ok so you like character development, that's helpful. What was a recent movie you really enjoyed? <|endoftext|> the avengers series <|endoftext|> Ah, the cast is wonderful in those, especially Robert Downey Jr. Are you looking for a super hero type movie then? <|endoftext|> He was my favorite. I like action but not typically at the forefront of the movie. Maybe something with Robert Downey Jr. too. He has always been my favorite <|endoftext|> Ok, and do you have a preference on genre with RDJ? Or as long as he is in it? <|endoftext|> Pretty much as long as he is in it is good <|endoftext|> I would recommend Sherlock Holmes. It stars Robert Downey Jr, was nominated for two Oscars, has action, drama, a little bit of everything! <|endoftext|> That sounds great, I will definitely take that recommendation. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Perfect. I can get that trailer sent over to you. It came out in 2009 so it's not new. Is that okay? <|endoftext|> that sounds great <|endoftext|> Ok. Would you like to know anything else or similar titles? <|endoftext|> is there a sequel to the movie? <|endoftext|> Yes! There is. I would recommend watching that following this. <|endoftext|> perfect i will jump in! <|endoftext|> Great. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> Thank you I will! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello I am here to recommend a movie to you! <|endoftext|> ok <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> up <|endoftext|> Good Movie! What Genre of Movie do you like? <|endoftext|> syfy.how about you? <|endoftext|> Syfy is my favorite along with Action! What is your favorite part about SyFy Movies? <|endoftext|> I really like movies with robots in it. <|endoftext|> Awesome me too! I would recommend Real Steal because of your interest in SyFy with Robots <|endoftext|> That is a good movie. <|endoftext|> What was one thing you didn't like about it? <|endoftext|> Honestly it was too short. <|endoftext|> I agree. What about Pacific Rim? <|endoftext|> I think #1 and #2 was awesome,im looking forward to #3. <|endoftext|> I missed the release of #2 so I am going to be watching it soon. Would you like to Rewatch the First one? <|endoftext|> yes absolutely <|endoftext|> OK that sounds great I would definitely recommend that movie it fits your taste. Another question have you watched Terminator? <|endoftext|> Ok thank you.I think everybody in the world seen Terminator... LOL. <|endoftext|> Lol that is true but there are a few out there in fact I just showed the series to one of my friends for the first time! <|endoftext|> Nice. Do you like the movie? <|endoftext|> Love it honestly its my favorite movie I would also recommend Surrogates it has Bruce Willis in it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Hello! I am doing well. I am looking for some action movies. Any good action movies you can recommend? <|endoftext|> Yes, I definitely can. For reference, what action movies have you liked in the past? <|endoftext|> I like the Mission Impossible series. Really like the last three new ones. <|endoftext|> Those are great movies! Here is a similar movie you might like. It is called Jack Reacher - The film starts with a killing spree of five people by a sniper. After being caught, he demands to see Mr. Reacher instead of seeing lawyers. And then begins the twists and turns - something that'll certainly impress you. <|endoftext|> Sounds fun. Isn't Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher too? <|endoftext|> Yes, he is! It is an excellent movie for you if you enjoy thriller/action movies! <|endoftext|> Of course I do. I enjoy movies with a good plot and a twist. When was the movie released in theaters? <|endoftext|> It was released back in 2012! Would you like to see a trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would like to see the trailer. <|endoftext|> Perfect! Let me pull that up for you. <|endoftext|> Thank you. I am really looking forward to it <|endoftext|> Here is the movie. <|endoftext|> By the way how long is the movie and who is in it besides Tom Cruise? I am now very interested <|endoftext|> Good question. It is 2 hours and 10 minutes long. Other actors in this movie include Paula Wagner, Don Granger, and Gary Levinsohn. <|endoftext|> Not bad! I bet time will fly when I am watching a good action movie. <|endoftext|> It definitely will. This is not a movie to fall asleep to! <|endoftext|> Well thank you so much. I will definitely check out the trailer for Jack Reacher <|endoftext|> You're welcome. I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Thanks! you have a good evening! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you in looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> thank for helping me <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailer you would like to see? <|endoftext|> no not really <|endoftext|> I recently saw QUOTATION_MARKFord vs FerrariQUOTATION_MARK. It had a great story line <|endoftext|> i am not into cars <|endoftext|> My wife really isn't into cars either. It's not really about cars. It stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale. The story revolves around their relationship <|endoftext|> i love animated movies <|endoftext|> Great. Did you see Frozen? Frozen 2 is now out <|endoftext|> no i havent seen frozen <|endoftext|> It's a great movie about two sisters and how they grow up. Funny side characters <|endoftext|> i heard there was an animated mpvie with will smith <|endoftext|> Yes! Spies in disguise. The trailer is very funny <|endoftext|> thats an animated movie i would like to see <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> yes i would like to see the trailer <|endoftext|> here is the plot: When the world's best spy is turned into a pigeon, he must rely on his nerdy tech officer to save the world. <|endoftext|> sounds interesting <|endoftext|> great. let me get you the trailer. Sound good? <|endoftext|> that sounds great <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> How are you?. Any recommendation? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds of movies, what is your favorite kind? <|endoftext|> What recommendation do you have for me? <|endoftext|> Since it is the holiday season I would recommend Christmas Vacation since it is funny. <|endoftext|> Why do you choose Christmas Vacation? <|endoftext|> It is a very funny movie <|endoftext|> Well, your recommendation is accepted. <|endoftext|> I am glad of that! Any other kinds you can think of? <|endoftext|> None for now or do you have more to recommend? <|endoftext|> If you like the Christmas Vacation move, they have a whole series that goes along with it. <|endoftext|> Oh that is cool. <|endoftext|> National Lampoon is the name of the series. I would stick with the ones of the first four or five of the series, as they are best. <|endoftext|> I'm sure the movie is an interesting one. <|endoftext|> I am glad that I was able to recommend a movie for you. <|endoftext|> It is a holiday season and the movie is for the season. <|endoftext|> You should start with the first movie to get you started <|endoftext|> Sure, I will start with the first season. <|endoftext|> Ok! It is called National Lampoon's Vacation <|endoftext|> oh that's better. thank you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there! I'm Rachel, who are you? <|endoftext|> Hi Rachel, I am Kevin. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies are your favorite kevin? <|endoftext|> I like the Avengers movies and superhero movies in general. I like science fiction and drama. <|endoftext|> Thats cool! What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Thanks. The last movie I watched was QUOTATION_MARKBrittany runs a MarathonQUOTATION_MARK on Amazon Prime Video. <|endoftext|> What did you like and dislike about that movie? <|endoftext|> I liked that the movie featured people of color, not just that, how it also featured an overweight woman. I liked that there was a triumph at the end for the movie's protagonist. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, I enjoy movies like that too. <|endoftext|> Nice, yeah. The movie kind of addressed some issues that I have been thinking about on my down time as well. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Pretty much the same as you. Have you ever seen Goldengirl? <|endoftext|> No, I have not. <|endoftext|> It came out in 1979, a doctor tries to make a superwoman out of his daughter. Does that sound like something you would enjoy? <|endoftext|> It sounds scary. I might not like it. Not many old films are worth watching, and I have not heard of this before today. <|endoftext|> How about starship troopers 2: Hero of the federation? It came out in 2004. It is an action packed Sci-Fi film <|endoftext|> That might be good. Does it have good reviews? Is there a Starship Troopers 1? <|endoftext|> Yes there is and it has lots of good reviews it also won an award <|endoftext|> What is it about? <|endoftext|> A group of troopers take refuge in an abandoned outpost after a fight against aliens, only to realize that more danger awaits them <|endoftext|> Oh wait, I think I might have seen that in college at a person's apartment. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer <|endoftext|> Yes, can you link me to it? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you? <|endoftext|> Great, thanks. So do you like movies? <|endoftext|> I love movies! I consider myself a movie buff <|endoftext|> Great! What kind of movies do you like? Drama? Action, Sci-fi? <|endoftext|> I'm into horror and Sci-fi, specially classics <|endoftext|> What was the last horror and sci-fi movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last horror movie was Midsommar, it was wonderful! I love beautiful cinematography <|endoftext|> Is Midsommar a movie you would recommend to watch? <|endoftext|> I would! It was very entertaining if you're into scary movies. <|endoftext|> I would tell you, if you like sci-fi and classics you should check out Alien. Do you know that movie? It combines horror and sci fi. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it yet! What is it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a spacecrew that encounters a hostile alien species that proceeds to kill all of them except one. Very tense, very scary, very interesting! I recommend you check it out!. <|endoftext|> Very interesting! Who is the director? <|endoftext|> Ridley Scott, great director, ever heard of him <|endoftext|> I have! Wow, that movie sounds awesome! I will watch it tonight, thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> no problem great to talk with you! <|endoftext|> Same to you! I hope you have a wonderful day! <|endoftext|> Forgot to ad, here is a detailed description of the plot for Alien: Ellen Ripley is rescued by a deep salvage team after being in hypersleep for 57 years. The moon that the Nostromo visited has been colonized, but contact is lost. This time, colonial marines have impressive firepower, but will that be enough? <|endoftext|> Sounds awesome! Thank you for adding that. I'm even more interested now that I know that it has a female protagonist! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> yes that would be great! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> something funny <|endoftext|> What's the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> Ford and Ferrari <|endoftext|> Would you like a movie with a similar story of a different one? <|endoftext|> a different one please <|endoftext|> Got it. <|endoftext|> what are you thinking? <|endoftext|> Not quite sure yet. <|endoftext|> okay - im pretty flexible <|endoftext|> How about Guardians of the Galaxy? <|endoftext|> i have already seen that movie but it was a good one <|endoftext|> I saw the first one but I haven't seen the second one. Would you like to watch that trailer? <|endoftext|> yes please <|endoftext|> The characters are really funny so I think you'll enjoy it. <|endoftext|> i like funny movies <|endoftext|> Okay. Animation with lots of action helps. <|endoftext|> it sure does <|endoftext|> So we're good to go with Guardaians of the Galaxy 2 then? <|endoftext|> yes i am <|endoftext|> Great. Enjoy! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, you have successfully connected.Let's get to viewing! <|endoftext|> Alright, let's do it! <|endoftext|> Are you a movie goer or do you like films to come to you at home via streaming? <|endoftext|> I like to watch movies at home via streaming. <|endoftext|> What streaming service(s) do you gravitate towards? <|endoftext|> I usually use Netflix for watching movies. <|endoftext|> What was the last Netflix film that really grabbed you? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed watching Saving Mr. Banks <|endoftext|> Do you like historical dramas? <|endoftext|> I like historical dramas if they are set past the year 1900. <|endoftext|> I feel like I'm the same way. Why would you say that it? <|endoftext|> I feel that movies that are more recent are able to be portrayed more accurately. I don't like watching actors fake accents of the way people used to talk before we had audio recording available. <|endoftext|> Older settings really allow for some creative liberties but the accuracy suffers. I agree. <|endoftext|> I do enjoy movies that are surrounding World War II. I also like to watch documentaries. <|endoftext|> Did you see Dunkirk? <|endoftext|> I did not see that movie. <|endoftext|> It's a strong cinematic achievement but harder to connect with on a human level because of the point of view it adopts. <|endoftext|> I understand that, I do tend to have a hard time enjoying films that have won many awards such as The Black Swan, Moneyball, and Hugo. <|endoftext|> I am going to strongly recommend Hacksaw Ridge <|endoftext|> Do you have any information on what the movie is about? <|endoftext|> Picture an unsung war hero who attains his valor without ever picking up a firearm <|endoftext|> That does sound like an intriguing movie. I would like to accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> You got it! The story of Desmond Doss. It will not disappoint. <|endoftext|> Thank you for the recommendation! I'm sure I will enjoy it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi! <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> what kinds of movies do you see in the theater, versus watching at home? <|endoftext|> Hmm...I like seeing movies with friends in theaters whereas at home I prefer just to watch by myself. Usually in theaters it is a big blockbuster or something recent. <|endoftext|> that big screen is a definite for big blockbusters! i take it action is your thing then? are you into the comic book movies that are popular now? <|endoftext|> Not really into comic book based moveis. More into space or time travel movies. <|endoftext|> oh yea! interstellar is a personal favorite of mine. have you seen donnie darko before? jake gyllenhaal is pretty young in it <|endoftext|> I really liked interseller and donnie darko is one of my favorite films. Are there others like them you would recommend? <|endoftext|> of course! time travel movies tend to fall on the funny or serious side, it sounds like a more serious one is up your alley. edge of tomorrow is with tom cruise, are you familiar with it? <|endoftext|> I am not, though I like tom cruise movies. <|endoftext|> this was a great movie about fighting aliens and reliving the same day (a bit like groundhog day). its called edge of tomorrow, but it was also known as live, die, repeat (which pretty much tells you what its about) <|endoftext|> Interesting. Did the movie have different names in different markets? <|endoftext|> yes, live, die, repeat was the movie's tagline, but went by that name in other markets. in a twist (for tom cruise at least), he initially doesnt know how to fight and hes trained by emily blunt <|endoftext|> lol. That sounds like a good movie for me to check out. I accept your recommendation. Do you have any others? <|endoftext|> looper is about time travelling to kill people (it's not as dark as that sounds), its a really interesting take on time travel with bruce willis and joseph gordon-levitt. not a spoiler, but joseph gordon-levitt plays a younger version of bruce willis <|endoftext|> I saw looper and really liked it. Looper is a good recommendation. I also liked inception. Are there anymore like that? <|endoftext|> cant mention time travel assassins without bringing up terminator or terminator 2...a real interesting take on the action/futuristic space genre is hardcore henry, the entire movie is shot first person <|endoftext|> Oh, I hadn't thought of looking back that far. I'll check out both terminator and terminator 2. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> thanks, glad i could help! ill also throw out chappie and ghost in the shell <|endoftext|> I have never heard of those two. What are they about? <|endoftext|> chappie takes place in the future where robots are common and can learn and grow much like humans, a police robot named chappie is wiped and retrained to be a criminal, lots of incredible action scenes and funny to boot (but its not a comedy) <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendations. I'll check them out. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy movies in your spare time? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I like to take my family out every once in a while. <|endoftext|> Me too. It is very expensive, so we also enjoy watching movies at home a lot. <|endoftext|> One of my kids says that she hates movies. It's kinda annoying and hard to find something she's willing to watch. I kinda gave up, so we watch what we want and she can do whatever she wants to do <|endoftext|> What kinds of trailers do you like? What is the last movie you saw that you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> In the theater... Star Wars. As a family, we've liked the Star Wars and Harry Potter series. <|endoftext|> So, lots of action and adventure!? With some fantasy  and magic in there, too? <|endoftext|> More like Sci-fi and/or fantasy <|endoftext|> We like sci fi, too! Do you have a favorite actor? <|endoftext|> I'm not very picky myself. Sorry, that's not a lot of help. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the Matrix!? That is a mind boggling sci fi movie!! Definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. <|endoftext|> Would you believe it... I have fallen asleep every time I've tried to watch it?? I don't know why. Maybe it's because I don't really like Keanu Reeves. <|endoftext|> That could be! Another one that was very entertaining was Blade Runner. It has Harrison Ford like in the Star Wars movies! <|endoftext|> What's it about? <|endoftext|> A blade runner must pursue and terminate four replicants, which are like robots created to help society and look/act like humans, who stole a ship in space. Then return to Earth and find their creator. It has a high 8.1 rating on IMDB! Which is super high. <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting. I'll check it out <|endoftext|> Perfect! I hope you will enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Me too :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. What kind of movies are you interested in? <|endoftext|> I like movies that have a good storyline, <|endoftext|> Which movies have you seen recently that you really enjoyed with a great story behind it? <|endoftext|> Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the Irishman had good storylines <|endoftext|> I was personally impressed by Charlie Says, have you seen this movie? Its interesting how things play out <|endoftext|> I have not heard of this film. Who is in it and what is it generally about? <|endoftext|> Matt Smith playing as Charles Manson, directed by Mary Harron. Its showing how certain a certain group of people that would do killings for Charles Manson and how they continued to pretty much worship him as their cult leader believing that their crimes were part of a cosmic plan until one day a member decides to make a change. <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting. I think I need to take a break from Charlie Manson. Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> My family and I really enjoyed The Hateful Eight starring Kurt Russel as a bounty hunter and his prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) they end up encountering another bounty hunter and a man that claims to be a QUOTATION_MARKsheriffQUOTATION_MARK. They end up being stuck in a blizzard and as they try to find shelter they encounter a couple other people and soon realize that getting to their destination might not happen. Everything that they encounter and go through keeps you on edge and interested to see whats going to happen next. <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree that was a good movie. I thought everyone did a good job acting, but I have seen it already. Maybe one more recommendation? I like comedies as well as dark comedies. <|endoftext|> Who is one of your favorite actors? <|endoftext|> Joaquin Phoenix <|endoftext|> He really is a great actor. Which of his movies did you enjoy the most? <|endoftext|> I enjoyed Signs the most probably. Her was also good. <|endoftext|> Since you mentioned dark comedies, which is your favorite so far? I really enjoyed Network. <|endoftext|> I like Fargo, Death of Stalin, 7 Psychopaths, etc. Network is a dark comedy then? <|endoftext|> Yes. It scored 8.1/10 on IMDB <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting. I will accept this recommendation and try it. Thank You <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you enjoy it as well as I did. <|endoftext|> thanks I will <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good evening <|endoftext|> Do you have any recommendations <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Action movies <|endoftext|> Who is your favorite actor? <|endoftext|> Edward nortan <|endoftext|> Hmmm. Not sure who he is. You got me there. Have you seen The Joker? <|endoftext|> No have you seen call of the wild with Harrison ford <|endoftext|> I have not seen that one yet. Want to. Looks really good. What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Field of dreams you <|endoftext|> The wilding on showtime <|endoftext|> Ok cool what else you like <|endoftext|> I am a huge horror movie fan. The Halloween series are my favorite. I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt like sci-fi movies though <|endoftext|> Ok I like halloween <|endoftext|> Cool. Have you seen the Rob Zombie remake of Halloween? <|endoftext|> Yes that was awesome <|endoftext|> First was better than second. Have you watched Ma? <|endoftext|> Never heard of it <|endoftext|> Came out last year. Very good I thought. More suspenseful than action. But I think you would like it <|endoftext|> I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm going to check it out <|endoftext|> I can\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt find the trailer in the list options <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! I'm Jessica, I will help you find a movie that is perfect for you. How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Hi Jessica, I am Jen. Do you have any movie recommendations? <|endoftext|> Hi Jen! That is my sister's name too :) I definitely have some recommedations. First, what was the last movie you watched that you really liked? <|endoftext|> This past weekend I watched Ford vs Ferrari and I thought it was good. <|endoftext|> Oh great! What an all-star cast that movie has. What were some aspects of the movie that you liked most? <|endoftext|> I liked that was about actual events, had humor, and was exciting during the racing events. It was a drama, but thrilling. <|endoftext|> Do you usually prefer movies that are about actual events? I love movies that have humor even if it's not an actual comedy. Humor is so necessary! <|endoftext|> Not necessarily do I prefer movies about actual events. I just find them interesting. I like movies that have a good message and I can watch with my family <|endoftext|> Okay awesome! So you prefer movies that can be watched with the whole family? <|endoftext|> yes, definitely! <|endoftext|> Are you and your family more engaged by fantasy/adventure films or more documentary style films? <|endoftext|> I would say fantasy/adventure...especially to keep my young boys interest <|endoftext|> Okay perfect! I think I have just the movie for you and the boys! <|endoftext|> Please tell me what you recommend <|endoftext|> The newest Avengers movie, Avengers: Endgame is a great family friendly movie. It will hold the attention of your younger children while still providing some subtle adult humor. It also provides a good message about working together as a team. The soundtrack is super catchy as well! <|endoftext|> I would agree, but we have already seen that movie. You are on the right track though. The whole family did enjoy that movie. <|endoftext|> Oh shoot! I'm glad I'm on the right track. That movie is too good to not have seen. Let me recommend another one to you now. <|endoftext|> Ok, can't wait to see what you come up with <|endoftext|> I would next recommend Spider-Man: Homecoming! Another great superhero movie winning 4 awards! <|endoftext|> Ok, sounds interesting. Haven't seen that one yet. Did you like it? <|endoftext|> I loved it! The new take on Spider-Man is super interesting as I was more familiar with Tobey Maguire's take on the classic superhero. <|endoftext|> Great! I will accept your recommendation and check this movie out! Thanks!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer to watch!:) <|endoftext|> Hi!

I enjoyed that one too! <|endoftext|> It was great! We have the same taste which is awesome :) <|endoftext|> Since you like Rom-Com I think you'll like The Proposal! It has Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock again! <|endoftext|> It does? I don't think I have seen that one, is it new? <|endoftext|> Nope, it's from 2009, which is a year after QUOTATION_MARKDefinitely, MaybeQUOTATION_MARK actually! <|endoftext|> Oh, wow!

It's called Just Friends, it doesn't have Sandra Bullocks, but I would say it's better!;) <|endoftext|> I would be open to both recommendations! If you think Just Friends is better, I will go with that! <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I would very much like to watch the Just Friends movie trailer! <|endoftext|> You are going to love it the movie! it's both funny and romantic! <|endoftext|> I am sure I will! I have seen a lot of movies with Ryan and he is one of my favorite actors. <|endoftext|> I agree! He is able to tackle many genres which is great. My favorite is still his performance in the Deadpool series <|endoftext|> Yes! I loved him in that role, he has made so many great movies! He was in a really funny older movie called, Waiting, so funny! <|endoftext|> Did you know that he won MTV award for best fight in his performance of Deadpool?! <|endoftext|> He did?

Looking for movies something like that one <|endoftext|> Why did you not like Parasite? <|endoftext|> First part was very slow, second part was very intense. I didn't like how they ended the movie. I expect more from an oscar movie <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it, But I heard it was a comedy/drama. Is that the type of movies yo like? <|endoftext|> Yes I like comedy/drama type very much <|endoftext|> You might like Booksmart. It's very funny. <|endoftext|> It is the first time I heard about it.

I liked that it was a mondern dayQUOTATION_MARKBigQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Who is playing in Shazam <|endoftext|> Zachary Levi plays the lead. It's kind of a kid type story. Another great kid story, and very hilarious is QUOTATION_MARKThe Good BoysQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I know Zachary Levi, he played Chuck too. I love Chuck. I don't like kids movies. Thank you though <|endoftext|> Ok, well there not kid movies like Toy Story, they are about kids.

I will accept this recommendation too <|endoftext|> Great, I' <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you!? <|endoftext|> Hello! How is it going today? <|endoftext|> I'm not too bad myself.

What type of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> I really like cheesy romantic movies that make you love to be in love. I like movies that are suspenseful but not corny. I dont like sci-fi or super heroes. And i definitely do not like comedies because most of the time they arent actually funny. <|endoftext|> I understand, its hard to find a funny movie you can actually laugh at. What is the most recent movie you have watched? <|endoftext|> The most recent movie that I watched was actually El Camino which a Netflix original following the TV show Breaking Bad. <|endoftext|> Is it a love type movie, or more action packed? <|endoftext|> That movie is much more action packed and suspenseful because it follows the story of a drug dealer. <|endoftext|> Oh wow. Did you like the movie, or was it to action packed for you? <|endoftext|> No i definitely liked it. I thought that the plot was great and the characters felt real. The action was intense but nothing too scary <|endoftext|> Well that is good. Did you like it more than you would have liked a love movie? <|endoftext|> I guess it just depends on the mood. Action is definitely hit or miss with me, but I would definitely like a recommendation for a romantic movie about love. <|endoftext|> Have you heard of the movie Always Be My Maybe? <|endoftext|> No i have not...is that an American made movie? <|endoftext|> It is an American made movie. It is a new movie this year. Do you like Christmas romance movies? <|endoftext|> I most definitely do! <|endoftext|> I do as well. I really like old fashion romance movies. But love the stuff on the Hallmark channel as well. <|endoftext|> Me too! Hallmark is the best! I dont even care if every movie has the same story. They are just wholesome movies to watch. <|endoftext|> They really are, I could watch the same one over and over again. <|endoftext|> Could you recommend one to me? <|endoftext|> I would recommend Always Be My Maybe. <|endoftext|> I think that sounds like a good choice for me!

Anything based on superheroes or similar. <|endoftext|> It sounds like you have a diverse genre of movies you like. Nothing boring, lol.

I don't enjoy romance movies and I'm picky about comedies lol. If you have any recommendations I would greatly appreciate them. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Pacific Rim? It's a few years older. It's about aliens and the humans that protect the planet against them. I know you said you like action, superheros, and sci-fi and this movie ticks all three. <|endoftext|> No I haven't seen that movie. I know of it but I haven't seen it yet! If it checks all three of those I will definitely look into it. Thank you for your help and recommendation. <|endoftext|> You're welcome. I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> I hope so too. I've heard it has great reviews. Are there any other movies you might recommend that are  action movies? <|endoftext|> If you like action, you might enjoy John Wick. If you aren't sensitive to violence, that is. <|endoftext|> It depends on the type of violence. I don't like violence such as movies like Saw. I don't like torture. <|endoftext|> This is about an ex-hit-man. It might not be your cup of tea. Have you seen the new Avengers movie? <|endoftext|> I might look into it but I'm not sure. I actually have seen the new Avengers movie. It was incredible. I do like Marvel and DC comics. <|endoftext|> I think I'd stick to my original recommendation. You should check out Pacific Rim. <|endoftext|> Alright then I will check pacific rim out. Thank you again  for your help! <|endoftext|> You're very welcome. <|endoftext|> Have a nice rest of your day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello I am here to help. <|endoftext|> i want a movie trailer <|endoftext|> What genres do you prefer? <|endoftext|> comedy <|endoftext|> Any certain actor? <|endoftext|> kevin james <|endoftext|> How about Mall Cop 2? <|endoftext|> sounds good <|endoftext|> It is, you won't be disappointed. <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> Your Welcome <|endoftext|> do you like comedies <|endoftext|> Yes I do. <|endoftext|> thats cool <|endoftext|> Paul Bart Mall Cop 2 has Kevin James in it.

I'd check them out before I even bothered with childs play. How's about netflix? <|endoftext|> Do you think the new pet sematary is better than the original? <|endoftext|> In my opinion no. By killing of the older sibling they removed the concept of death (being introduced to a child) and generally took the zombie movie avenue with the films direction. Still a great movie, but not as good as the original <|endoftext|> what would you rate the movie? <|endoftext|> 5 out of 10 <|endoftext|> what do you rate the childs play reboot? <|endoftext|> 3 out of 10! lol <|endoftext|> and IT chapter 2? <|endoftext|> 6 out of 10 <|endoftext|> Thanks, I accept your recommendation of the pet semetary reboot. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> hello, what do you recommend? <|endoftext|> what kind of movies do you like <|endoftext|> action or comedy <|endoftext|> Ok, can you tell me what movies you have seen lately <|endoftext|> the last few movies i have wateched are superbad, the beatles movie where everyone forgets about the beatles, and avengers end game <|endoftext|> Ok, would you like a movie that lots of shooting or more of martial art or you do not mind which <|endoftext|> i prefer shooting if its action, or sci fi action <|endoftext|> ok, then <|endoftext|> so what do you recommend? <|endoftext|> I would suggest you see John Wick, it's a one of a kind <|endoftext|> Ive heard that on is really good.

Do you recommend anything scary? <|endoftext|> If you like scary movies then Annabelle will make you jump its based on a real life story, so just wondering out of all the recommendations which one will you watch first_ <|endoftext|> Out of all of these recommendations, I would first want to watch Fast and Furious Hobbs and Shaw. <|endoftext|> That is a great movie you will like the trailer a lot, Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham sure make a great team, have a nice day. <|endoftext|> It sounds like a lot of fun. I accept this recommendation. <|endoftext|> So it seems like the trailer for that movie is not available maybe go with Deadpool 1 trailer? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there!

My name is Erin. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> My favorite type of movie is mystery. I like where there is a big twist at the end. I also love ones if they are based off of books. Gone Girl is one example I really like. Do you have any recommendations in this genre? <|endoftext|> I'm not sure I have a good movie that could catch your interest, but right now on TV I'm watching a show call QUOTATION_MARKThe StrangerQUOTATION_MARK that perfectly fit what you like. <|endoftext|> Actually my mom just recommended that to me! Harlan Coban wrote that book and he is one of my favorite authors. <|endoftext|> It's really good. I'm sure it has all the things you look for and it has so many twists that you stay engaged all the time. <|endoftext|> Ok great! I will try it! <|endoftext|> Perfect. I'm sure you'll like it. <|endoftext|> Thank you so much for the recommendation! I'm looking forward to watching it! <|endoftext|> It does not show on the selection of movies that I'm suppouse to look <|endoftext|> My second favorite genre of movies is romantic comedies.. do you have an recommendations for that? <|endoftext|> Yes, but I'm sure you have al ready seen it <|endoftext|> What is it? <|endoftext|> Love Actually :-) <|endoftext|> I actually haven't seen it! I've always heard about it though. Why do you recommend that one? <|endoftext|> It's really funny all the way through and has a lot of romantic moments that will make you cry and laugh. <|endoftext|> Ok great! I'll have to check if it is on Netflix! <|endoftext|> Yes, try it there. if not I'm sure you can find it at Walmart or Target for really cheap <|endoftext|> Ok great thanks! <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you? <|endoftext|> I am well, thanks for asking. Today I came to talk about your favorite movies as of recent times. What is your favorite movie that you've seen recently? <|endoftext|> I just watched Ford v Ferrari last week and I really enjoyed it. Had good acting and I thought it was an interesting story. <|endoftext|> That sounds like an interesting film! What genre would you categorize this movie as? Is i your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Its hard to categorize it, but I would say Action or History. It tells a real story in the movie and the story is entertaining and exciting. There is some action involved. I guess I like true stories about people who did things that were amazing and adventurous. <|endoftext|> Oh, I see! So you like true stories, such as of historical figures of people who have accomplished notable things! I am trying to get the best picture of what makes you get on the edge of your seat when you watch. <|endoftext|> Yeah they don't have to be war movies, but I do like those a lot as well. <|endoftext|> And you mention war movies. Do you like the action aspect of war movies more, or the fact that it is real more? For example, do you also like action movies which are Marvel-based? <|endoftext|> I do like Marvel movies as well. I haven't seen all of them but I watch Iron Man, and Captain America and liked those movies quite a bit. I think I get more out of a movie that seems more real like a Saving Private Ryan but I also like to watch movies that are more fun and imaginative like Marvell as well. <|endoftext|> I see. For you, I recommend Black Mass. This movie is a true biographical film which revolves around an alliance between the FBI and the Irish Mob. This is also an action film. <|endoftext|> I think I heard of that but I haven't seen it yet. Is that the movie that has Johnny Depp in it or an I thinking of the wrong movie? <|endoftext|> That is correct! This movie has Johnny Depp and it is a true film telling of events which took place in the 1970's. You may like this movie if you end up watching it! <|endoftext|> I think I really would. Its an interesting era to set the film in as well and I would like seeing the way they portray the 70's in the movie. I think I will watch that movie sounds like a good recommendation. <|endoftext|> Do you appreciate these types of films which do take place in older times, aside from modern films? <|endoftext|> I do like those a lot, even if I wasn't born in the time period. I just think seeing the old cars, the way people dressed, and less technology in the movies is interesting. <|endoftext|> That is very nice. Then I think you will enjoy this movie. It can be characterized as being QUOTATION_MARKclassicQUOTATION_MARK due to the elements you enjoy about older times. <|endoftext|> Sounds great, thank you very much for your help. <|endoftext|> Of course! Enjoy the recommendation. I hope it suits your tastes. Have a good day! <|endoftext|> You have a good day as well. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> im good thanks. what types of movies you like? <|endoftext|> That's good. I like to watch thrilling action movies or dramatic movies. <|endoftext|> nice. Whats the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was The Bucket List. Do you have any recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> Same kind of Different as me. <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of that before, I'll go look up a trailer for it. <|endoftext|> there you go. <|endoftext|> That looks interesting, what did you like about it? <|endoftext|> has a good positive message. Be grateful <|endoftext|> Nice, I like that. That seems like a good movie, I accept your recommendation. Thank you. <|endoftext|> thanks you! <|endoftext|> Do you have another recommendation for me? That was a good one for drama. An action one would be nice as well. <|endoftext|> IP Man is good if you like karate movies <|endoftext|> I definitely like karate movies. I have seen IP Man, I enjoyed that one a lot. That actor that plays the main character is very talented. <|endoftext|> i only seen part 1. Not the others. I have to check them out. But John Wick 3 is pretty cool. <|endoftext|> Yes you should, I enjoyed them as well. I haven't seen John Wick 3 yet, only the first 2, but I liked them a lot. Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> No Problem. <|endoftext|> Well I will check out all of your recommendations, is there anything else you'd like to say? <|endoftext|> That is all thanks. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> good afternoon <|endoftext|> Hello! Do you have a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> Back to the future is a great movie series. How about you? <|endoftext|> Awesome! I've heard about that movie but have never got the chance to see it. What's the plot, again? I just saw Blank Panther, and loved it! Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> Yes i have, and thought it was a great movie. Its about this kid named Marty and how he got sent back in time before he was born. He's basically got to get his parents back together so that he has a future. <|endoftext|> Oh that's right, I'm remembering what it's about again. Is the acting good? <|endoftext|> Its an older movie but i think the acting is great. It was such a hit they made a second and third movie as well. <|endoftext|> Wow, I think I'm going to watch it in the near future. You've convinced me. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> My pleasure! <|endoftext|> Out of the three which one is the best? <|endoftext|> The second one was definetly my favorite. The first one they go to the past, but the second one they go to the future. Its interesting to see their take on what the future will look like! <|endoftext|> Oh, awesome. Where do they go in the 3rd one? <|endoftext|> The third one takes place way in the past. Its when the town he lives in is just starting out. <|endoftext|> Oh okay, that's awesome. Should I watch them in order? If I skip right to the second one will I be confused? <|endoftext|> You dont really need to watch the first in order to understand the second, but i would reccomend it as it shows why they must go to the future. It also shows how the characters have progressed throughout the 3 movies! <|endoftext|> That makes sense. Is there a love story involved? <|endoftext|> Yes the main character marty and his girlfriend are shown througout the 3 films.The 2nd movie shows this the most. <|endoftext|> Awesome, I can't wait to watch all three! <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy them as much as i did! <|endoftext|> me too, thanks again! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Have you watched any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes, I watched The King just the other night. <|endoftext|> Great! What was that about? <|endoftext|> It was a dramatization of a few of Shakespeare's plays about King Henry the V of England. <|endoftext|> Do you typically enjoy movies that have a historical perspective? <|endoftext|> Yes, I generally do. I really like the ones set in either Roman or Medieval times. <|endoftext|> Have you seen movies like Gladiator or The Last Legion? <|endoftext|> I loved Gladiator, but I haven't heard of The Last Legion. What is that about? <|endoftext|> 2007 About the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Directed by Dino De Lorentis (sp?) <|endoftext|> That sounds like something I would enjoy. How did you like it? <|endoftext|> Loved it. <|endoftext|> Great! I will definitely check it out. Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Another one, but this one I haven't seen. It's called Barbarian Queen. It's also about the Roman Empire. <|endoftext|> Hm, I'll have to add that one to the list too. Have you heard good things about it? <|endoftext|> I just looked up more info about it, but I can't say I recommend it. It doesn't have a good rating. Let me check again for another. <|endoftext|> Ok, good to know. Let me know when you have another one. <|endoftext|> Just checking, and I assume you have seen it, but have you seen Gladiator? <|endoftext|> Yes. That was a fantastic movie! <|endoftext|> I thought so, but just wanted to be sure. Looking for one more for you... <|endoftext|> Cool, thanks! <|endoftext|> Found it. It's old though and I hope that's OK. Title:  Julius Caesar. 1953 It has Marlon Brando, James Mason, and others. Won an Oscar with other accolades as well. <|endoftext|> I'd love to see that! I spent a lot of time studying Roman culture and history, so that would be great. Thank you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good afternoon! <|endoftext|> Good afternoon, I am looking for a Horror movie! <|endoftext|> What kind of Horror movie do you like: Supernatural, Monster, Serial Killer? <|endoftext|> Serial Killer. <|endoftext|> Do you like ones based on true stories or more like Halloween/Friday the 13th? <|endoftext|> I like both! <|endoftext|> What was the last Horror movie that you loved? <|endoftext|> The old horror movies like The hills have eyes or chainsaw massacre. The new horror movies are not that great. The last 2 scary movies that I watched were totally bad. They were QUOTATION_MARKITQUOTATION_MARK and Jeepers Creepers. I also love Zombie movies! <|endoftext|> Oh nice I love Zombie movies too. Have you seen 28 Days Later? <|endoftext|> I did. <|endoftext|> I think I have a few suggestions. Give me one sec. <|endoftext|> Ok. No problem. <|endoftext|> Have you seen 30 Days of Night? It is a little slower but has some really tense moments and revolves around vampires. <|endoftext|> I hven't. I have been meaning to watch it, but tought it would be bad. Will try it!! Thank you!! <|endoftext|> Excellent. I hope you enjoy it!!! <|endoftext|> Thank you. <|endoftext|> It is definitely a hit or miss movie but I think based on your likes that you might be a hit :D <|endoftext|> I hope so, becaue lately horror movies are just not worth the time. I heard World War Z 2 was sort of coming out, but they cancelled it. I would love to watch it because the first one was good. <|endoftext|> Yeah, would've been great if that went through. The only recent Horror movies I've really gotten into was the Conjuring series. <|endoftext|> I watchd it, but I loved the first one but not the 2nd one. <|endoftext|> I can agree with that. First one was amazing. The 2nd was just a rehash. Thanks for the chat and I hope you enjoy 30 Days of Night! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, <|endoftext|> hello there,what do you recommend? <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i prefer comedies <|endoftext|> What is your favorite comedy? <|endoftext|> at this time i like Christmas comedies,especially those that are cast at Europe <|endoftext|> Do you like action comedies with superheros? <|endoftext|> ok lets try <|endoftext|> Shazaam is a great movie that just was out in theatres and no on Redbox <|endoftext|> really ok I accept <|endoftext|> I think you'll love the heartwarming story of a teenage foster child who turns into a superhero! <|endoftext|> where it is casted? <|endoftext|> Photography took place in Canada. <|endoftext|> has the movie won any award? <|endoftext|> It won a national film and television award in 2019 <|endoftext|> when is the movie released? <|endoftext|> It was released this year. <|endoftext|> oh nicee i would love to watch it this weekend <|endoftext|> It grossed very high in the UK!

I also like love stories <|endoftext|> I like horror movies too, I like the adrenaline they bring. What is the latest movie you've watched <|endoftext|> Oh good! Then we definetely have something in common. The latest movie I seen was QUOTATION_MARKBad BoysQUOTATION_MARK. What about you? <|endoftext|> Me too, I love Will Smith. what did you like about it? <|endoftext|> Yes! I know this might sound weird, but I really loved that they were able to make one last movie, being as though the others came out years ago. But I did find that it was extremely funny, and surprising that there was a son that was unknown on there. What did you like about it? <|endoftext|> I like the fact that it manages to transcend its hoariest tropes. <|endoftext|> Lol! Exactly. What movie would you recommend me to see? <|endoftext|> I remember you said you like love stories right? <|endoftext|> Yes, That is correct <|endoftext|> I would recommend The Photograph its a a love story of an African American love. And since we are in the love month it's perfect <|endoftext|> I think that is something I would enjoy! I have heard people talk about it and wanted to see for myself. Thank you! I think I will see it this weekend. <|endoftext|> You should, it will bring in a new perspective to how you view love stories <|endoftext|> What did you think about the movie? <|endoftext|> I liked the fact that it talks about a lot of relationships from mother-daughter, health, friendships and dating <|endoftext|> That is interesting. Would you say that it is a different kind of love story, or something we have seen in other movies? <|endoftext|> Definitely different not the usual black love story <|endoftext|> Okay good. I normally feel skeptical when they are resulting in the same love stories. But you have brought a new light to my view <|endoftext|> Also you can watch Carol its also a nice love story, do you want to watch  a trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, can you send it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, my name is Bernie, would you like a recommendation on a movie. If so, please tell me what type of  movies you enjoy. <|endoftext|> Comedy <|endoftext|> one moment please, while i look for something you may enjoy. <|endoftext|> Ok <|endoftext|> What was the last comedy that you watched that made you really laugh? <|endoftext|> Frozen two <|endoftext|> That is a great animation show that is rated for all audiences. <|endoftext|> Yes it is <|endoftext|> Got it <|endoftext|> Yes I love great animation shows <|endoftext|> Do you like movies also, not animation? <|endoftext|> Yes I do <|endoftext|> Would you enjoy a standup show? <|endoftext|> Sure would <|endoftext|> Do you like Amy Schumer? <|endoftext|> not really <|endoftext|> Ok, I understand.

It's about the intersection of organized crime and politics. <|endoftext|> what era? <|endoftext|> The 1960s and 1970s <|endoftext|> sounds interesting <|endoftext|> I agree. I highly recommend it. <|endoftext|> sounds good <|endoftext|> Great, enjoy watching QUOTATION_MARKThe IrishmanQUOTATION_MARK! The Jimmy Hoffa story from the film is really interesting. <|endoftext|> Nice. Thanks. <|endoftext|> Also, it is a Martin Scorcese film, starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. <|endoftext|> Oh. I hate Scorcese usually, but I'll give it a shot. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I haven't liked some of his past films like QUOTATION_MARKGangs of New YorkQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> So can I see the trailer? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> What movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like really good sci fi movies, but I do not like action movies. <|endoftext|> Did you see Martian? <|endoftext|> No, I did not. I don't really like Matt Damon very much. <|endoftext|> I know its better if you like the actors in it This isn't sci-fi, but did you see Bohemian Rhapsody? I really liked that film. <|endoftext|> I did see it! I also thought it was very good. In addition to sci fi I also enjoy biographies and history. <|endoftext|> We just saw Ford verses Ferrari. That was awsome! <|endoftext|> I've never heard of that movie, can you tell me more about it? <|endoftext|> Ford wanted to make a sports car in order to be competitive with other car companies. <|endoftext|> I didn't know that! What actors and actresses are in the film? <|endoftext|> Matt Damon and Christian Bale. We saw it at an IMax. My husband is a sports fan.

You won't be sorry! <|endoftext|> Do you have any other recommendations for movies that don't have Matt Damon? <|endoftext|> I also saw JUDY. It was ok It's a little about her biography. <|endoftext|> Is that the one with Renee Zellweger? <|endoftext|> Yes it is. You might enjoy that one. <|endoftext|> Do you know if she does her own singing in the film or do they dub Judy Garland's voice in? <|endoftext|> Yes she did her own singing <|endoftext|> Oh wow! Did she do a good job? <|endoftext|> She did a great job on Somewhere Over The Rainbow! <|endoftext|> That sounds like something I would like to watch on my own, and maybe the other movies with my partner. Thank you for the recommendation, I will definitely check out Judy! <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How is your day going? <|endoftext|> So far so good, thanks for asking! <|endoftext|> Glad to hear it. I'm here to help you find a new movie. What are you interested in lately? <|endoftext|> A good western would be nice, or perhaps something science fiction. <|endoftext|> Do you have any favorite actors/actresses I should look for? <|endoftext|> Clint Eastwood, John Wayne, Christian Bale, Kurt Russell, I'm not super picky though. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Hostiles with Christian Bale? <|endoftext|> I have, that one was pretty disappointing. Pretty boring if you ask me, which is a shame because the casting wasn't bad. Could you recommend something else? <|endoftext|> Never Grow Old is a newer western movie with one of my favorite actors, John Cusack. Would you like more information about it? <|endoftext|> Sorry, never been a fan of John Cusack. Maybe something else? Perhaps a science fiction film. <|endoftext|> Ah, he's not everyone's cup of tea. I found a film called QUOTATION_MARKCaptive StateQUOTATION_MARK that explores a post-alien occupation in mainland USA. Does that sound interesting to you? <|endoftext|> Yeah that sounds interesting, could you tell me more about it? Are there any actors of note in it? <|endoftext|> John Goodman is the lead, and gives a great dramatic performance, highlighting the conflict between the people who collaborated with the alien occupation and those who disented. <|endoftext|> Can you tell me how long the film is? <|endoftext|> Of course! It runs 1 hour and 49 minutes. <|endoftext|> Cool, thanks. Sounds interesting, thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> I'm glad you <|endoftext|> Can't wait to check it out and watch the trailer! <|endoftext|> Great I'll send it to you now! <|endoftext|> Ok, thanks again. Take care <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there! <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> What have you been up to? <|endoftext|> I'm sitting here in my living room trying to think of a new movie to watch. I really like high intensity and motivational movies. <|endoftext|> Really? What are some of your favorite movies that you've seen? <|endoftext|> Some of the movies I recently seen have been THE JOKER and UNCUT GEMS. The intensity was super high, almost giving me anxiety, but I still loved it. <|endoftext|> I loved THE JOKER! Joaquin Phoenix is the man! <|endoftext|> Right?! He did an excellent job. I was also really surprised by Adam Sandler's performance, he did a great job as well. <|endoftext|> Have you ever heard of GOOD WILL HUNTING? <|endoftext|> I actually haven't, care to explain a little bit more about it or who is in it? <|endoftext|> It's about a man named Will Hunting, played by Matt Damon, who has a gift for mathematics. He has had to endure some troubles in his life and he needs some guidance from a psychologist played by Robin Williams. Would you be interested in seeing the trailer? <|endoftext|> Wow that actually sounds like a great movie! I'm an engineer myself so I feel like I would connect with Matt. I also dearly loved Robin Williams, so it will be nice to see him acting. Yes, would definitely be interested in watching the trailer. <|endoftext|> Well that's good, I would highly recommend watching the trailer a little bit before taking the time to buy it just in case, lol <|endoftext|> When you buy movies, where or how do you should buy them from? <|endoftext|> I personally try to rent movies, it's cheaper, or I use a subscription service to watch my movies. What about you? <|endoftext|> I used to rent them from a REDBOX which is outside of 7/11's and you can rent them for like $1, but I just pay a little bit more and rent them on my smart tv which is more convenient. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I'm a college student who can't really afford a nice smart tv, so a laptop is all I generally use. <|endoftext|> Don't worry, I was doing the same as well. All of my movie watching was on my laptop. The movie you just mentioned, is an older movie right? <|endoftext|> That is correct, it came out in 1997. <|endoftext|> Oh nice! I loved movies that came out in that era, the plots were so good. <|endoftext|> Well hey, have a good day I'll be sure to send you the trailer via chat okay? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there! I hear you're interested in movies. May I ask what kind of movies you enjoy? <|endoftext|> Absolutely! I was looking for a reccomendation acutally. I LOVE horror moview <|endoftext|> Thats awesome! What kind of horror movies do you like? Something more suspense/thriller? Vampire/Supernatural? Gore? <|endoftext|> I love supernatural, vampires are always good too. One of my favorites of all time was 30 days of night. I also like movies that can surprise me. Ones that I think I know the tropes, and something crazy comes out of left field <|endoftext|> 30 days of night is definitely a good one. What are some other horror movies you've enjoyed recently? <|endoftext|> I saw Fantasy Island just the other day. It was surprisingly good, even though the reviews have said otherwise. I actually run a horror movie podcast for international horror movies. Just recently we spoke about Under the Shadow, a horror movie on Netflix. Amazing movie. I wanted to go see Brahms 2, but I'm worried it is going to be a waste of money. I also saw The Grudge (the one that came out this year). It was so bad it was funny. lol <|endoftext|> Haha I can certainly see finding good humor in The Grudge. If you like QUOTATION_MARKso terrible its funnyQUOTATION_MARK types of films, Phantasm was definitely one of my favorites. Definitely over the top, and the special effects were just absolutely icing on the cake. It's a great one if you're into the older films as well. Another I can recommend that was a bit more on the serious side... have you seen Midsommer? <|endoftext|> I have heard of Phantasm but haven't seen, it, but it is on the list. Love the QUOTATION_MARKso terrible its funnyQUOTATION_MARK type! Just went to a midnight showing of The Room, and got to meet Tommy Wiseau!! If you love those types of movies, that is definitely one of the best. I did see Midsommar! It was sooooooo interesting. Very twisty, very weird, right up my odd alley. LOL. Phantasm just jumped to the top of my list today!! <|endoftext|> That's awesome! The first one is very 70's old horror flick. I watched it as a teenager, and still remember how so-bad-but-funny it was even ten years later. I'm so glad we could find a good one for you to add to the list! <|endoftext|> I appreciate it! I definitely appreciate the recommendation and I can't wait to watch it! Thank you so much! I enjoyed the chat! <|endoftext|> For sure! Are there any other kinds of movies you'd like recommendations for? I have a few more horror-esque flicks as well if you're interested! <|endoftext|> I'm definitely interested in a few more horro-esque recommendations! Im always up for expanding the list. I'm going to a horror film fest in June, and I want to expand my library quickly:-) <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Cursed? Christina Ricci, werewolf movie! Not too great ratings, but I love how they did the werewolves in that. I wish they'd have used similar styles to translate to other popular films! <|endoftext|> I haven't!! I think I remember seeing commercials for it, or maybe it was an article online. I think Ive learned I cant trust ratings. That is going on my list to watch tonight too! Im curious to see what you mean about the werewolves. That's something that is always such a hit or miss for me. I do love the werewolves in What We Do In The Shadows though! Two great recommendations!! Awesome!! Thanks so much! <|endoftext|> It's definitely a little cheesy, but for the time of release on the movie, I feel like the werewolf CGI was pretty well done. And, I gotta throw this one out there for you as well, have you seen Queen of the Damned? Those vampires are something else for sure! <|endoftext|> I have!! Its one of my favorites:-) I see we have very similar tastes. Any other vampire ones you like? <|endoftext|> I will say, I was a fan of Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter as well. I didn't think I'd like it as I am, honestly, very reserved about gore in horror films and am not a fan. But I found that one to be absolutely tasteful, not overly done at all for what they had in it! May I also recommend more of a suspense film that is a little more on the side of ghosts and hauntings than vampires? <|endoftext|> Interesting. Another one I haven't seen that piques my curiosity. Yes please, what is the suspense film that you think I would like? <|endoftext|> Ah! Excellent. You'll be well prepared for your podcast up and coming ;) I also highly recommend Gothika. Halle Berry plays the main role, and the twist at the end is just absolutely stunning if you ask me. Definitely one of my personal favorites! <|endoftext|> Oh interesting. Halle Berry in a suspense film that has to do with ghosts??!! Sign me up! It was awesome talking to you! Thank you so much! I will be very well prepared:) <|endoftext|> No problem! I hope these all helped! You sound like you have some pretty great tastes and are well on your way yourself! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello partner <|endoftext|> Hey there. What do you know about romantic comedies, but not too shallow? <|endoftext|> Well, I know a little bit about them from the late 2000's <|endoftext|> Oh something current sounds great. I am okay with dry humor, in fact all types of humor. I like good acting and stories with meaning too. Alll wrapped up in one. <|endoftext|> The last romantic comedy I saw was Train Wreck with Amy Schumer. Have you seen that movie? <|endoftext|> Not yet. I do not like her too much. I loved Silver Linings tho. <|endoftext|> I never saw silver linings but I like both Jennifer lawerence and bradly cooper... Actually have you seen Long Shot with Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron? <|endoftext|> Loved Long Shot! Great acting. Anything around like that? <|endoftext|> Ya, me too... Did you ever see the classic Knocked UP? <|endoftext|> I have not but heard it was very funny. That is exactly what I will see tonight. Thanks so much! <|endoftext|> Very good, glad I could help! <|endoftext|> Who is in that by the way? <|endoftext|> Seth Rogan and a huge cast of others you will recognize <|endoftext|> What did you like best about it? <|endoftext|> Its just all around funny. I hope you enjoy it. have a fun night <|endoftext|> Ok thanks. Do you need to officially recommend it so I can accept or reject it? <|endoftext|> I reccommend the movie Knocked UP <|endoftext|> That is what I will watch. Thanks again for your help. <|endoftext|> I selected knocked up but I think we need to go a couple more turns before its done? <|endoftext|> Got it. How long ago did you see Knocked up? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hai <|endoftext|> good morning <|endoftext|> have you watched any movies in past few months? <|endoftext|> A couple, not too many. <|endoftext|> will you say that movie name? <|endoftext|> it's different chrsitmas movies on hallmark <|endoftext|> how was the experience on that movie? <|endoftext|> Oh i loved them. My favorite is the Christmas Spirit <|endoftext|> it that any special on that movie you would like ot say about cinematography <|endoftext|> it's just a good christmas movie, with a little bit of suspense thrown in there. My all time favorite christmas movie is the Grinch with Jim Carrey <|endoftext|> okay thank you <|endoftext|> do you have any good thriller, suspense movie recommendations <|endoftext|> i like ballers <|endoftext|> never head of it. can you give me a quick synopsis <|endoftext|> Steve Carell movies <|endoftext|> oh...so more so comedy <|endoftext|> oh..thanks do you like it <|endoftext|> I prefer something dramatic, thriller, suspense...do you like any movie in that genre <|endoftext|> no i like to watch only comedy flim <|endoftext|> ok. i will watch the baller trailer if you want to send it to me didn't know it has dewayne johnson in it...major plus, love him <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi, I am looking for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I would an horror movie, something to get my adrenaline pumping <|endoftext|> Let's see. Do you like any of the Purge movies? <|endoftext|> Not really, but I've seen them <|endoftext|> Do you like traditional horror movies, ie - chainsaw, masks. Or do you like 'new' horror movies that are more psychologically draining... <|endoftext|> would prefer the later <|endoftext|> Have you heard of Midsommar? <|endoftext|> No I haven't <|endoftext|> You should take a look at that trailer...talk about a psychological thrill ride <|endoftext|> this seems intyeresting <|endoftext|> I selected it for you. I really enjoyed it. <|endoftext|> Oh cool, I will make sure to watch it, I love movies that makes the hairs at the back of my neck stand <|endoftext|> This will certainly do that. It's a creepy story about a couple that goes to a remote village in Sweden for what they think is a festival...only to be in a land where the sun never goes down, and when the festival starts...the people of the village start to act weird <|endoftext|> Niceeee, I'm so adding this to my list of movies to watch tonight. Thanks <|endoftext|> I can't imagine being in that situation with my wife <|endoftext|> same here, as much as i love such movies, I hope to never be in such situations <|endoftext|> Do you like IT? <|endoftext|> Yes I do. Thanks so much. <|endoftext|> I would recommend the 2nd installment of that movie as well <|endoftext|> Let me see this first. Thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good afternoon! <|endoftext|> Hi there, how are you? Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> I think so. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like documentaries, films that reallly offer up a unique worldview and new perspective on things. The more out there and interesting the better. <|endoftext|> What is a documentary that you have watched recently that you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I saw one called Fantastic Fungi all about mushrooms, mould, and spores. I also like films that focus on the arts. <|endoftext|> What did you like about them? <|endoftext|> I liked it because it enlightened me about things in the natural world that I already did not know. I like learning more about nature and the world around me. Then I can hopefully apply it to my daily life and life a more fulfilled and interesting experience. <|endoftext|> Have you watched any more from the director of Louis Schwartzberg? <|endoftext|> No, I don't think so. What kinds of films has he directed? <|endoftext|> He has done several called Moving Art: Forests, Oceans, Waterfalls. Wings of Life. Mysteries of the Unseen <|endoftext|> Cool! I have never heard of those before. What one did you like best? <|endoftext|> Mysteries of the Unseen <|endoftext|> What exactly is the plot or subject matter surrounding that one? <|endoftext|> There are many things around us that we can't see, an QUOTATION_MARKunseen world.QUOTATION_MARK It's a very beautiful and interesting film about thins you don't even know existed (well me.) <|endoftext|> Really awesome, something that I really enjoy and can appreciate. I will certainly look it up and I will accept your recommendation to view this film. Thanks again! <|endoftext|> Nice you're welcome! <|endoftext|> Yes, thank you very much, maybe we can get together and watch a fil, some time! <|endoftext|> Sounds great <|endoftext|> And while we are at it, I just wanted to say that I love films with a scifi bent. But nature is the most important thing to our daily livlihood. That is why I like this in documantaried, and that is why I totally accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am hear to help you pick a movie. <|endoftext|> I like spooky movies. What should I watch that has demonic possession themes? <|endoftext|> Spooky movies are a great choice! Are you looking for something old or something new? <|endoftext|> Something new. I've seen almost all the classics. <|endoftext|> What are some of your favorites? <|endoftext|> Exorcism was ok. I recently watched Annabelle, and it was great. <|endoftext|> Annabelle is great! There is something about possessed dolls that really just kind of freaks people out isn't there? When I was a kid, I was terrified by the Child's Play movies. Did you like those too? <|endoftext|> Yeah. I know there are three Annabelle movies, should I watch the next two? <|endoftext|> Certainly, but I have another in mind that is coming out tomorrow. Have you heard of QUOTATION_MARKBrahms: The Boy II?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. Is it a sequel? <|endoftext|> It is and looks crazy scary. Definitely watch the original first as it will set you up to be terrified in this new one. Would you like to view the trailer for the original? <|endoftext|> Yes that sounds fun. <|endoftext|> Ok, I will get that queued up for you. In the meantime, here's the Plot:  An American nanny is shocked that her new English family's boy is actually a life-sized doll. After she violates a list of strict rules, disturbing events make her believe that the doll is really alive. <|endoftext|> Sounds great. Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> It is my pleasure. This particular one also got 6 nominations. I am sure that sequel is going to....kill....in the box office. <|endoftext|> I liked the Paranormal Activity movies too. They made a bunch of sequels, and they were all reasonably good and not just a box office cash grab. <|endoftext|> Those are pretty fantastic. I watched the first two alone in my bedroom with the lights off. They had me looking around the room thinking stuff was moving. The 3rd one I saw in the theater which I think took away from the scariness a bit. <|endoftext|> While more horror than scary, I liked the original Saw. The sequels and the plotline just got so convoluted and weird. <|endoftext|> There's a new one coming out with Samuel L. Jackson and Chris Rock called QUOTATION_MARKSpiral: From the Book of Saw.QUOTATION_MARK I just saw the trailer for it last weekend. It looks pretty decent. I'm not sure how I feel about Chris Rock having a serious roll though. That's certainly out of character for him. <|endoftext|> Samuel L Jackson gonna drop mad f-bombs every time he encounters a new trap... <|endoftext|> Hahahahahaha. That is so true. Anyway, here comes the trailer. I hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> HI <|endoftext|> Hey! <|endoftext|> I'm looking for new movies to watch <|endoftext|> Great, I'm always down to watch a movie. Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Did you watch Joker? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't yet. But I'm not super into superhero type plots, though I don't really know much about the Joker. Also heard some things about it being all from his side and glorifying doing bad things because the world has treated you badly. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> Yes and i recommend you also to watch, and what kind of a movie you like to watch? <|endoftext|> Okay good to know. <|endoftext|> what kind of movies you like to watch? <|endoftext|> I like horror movies or dark comedies or artsy movies. I don't like romance or action. <|endoftext|> then i suggest you to watch Conjuring movie <|endoftext|> The original one? Or a sequel? <|endoftext|> the sequel <|endoftext|> Oh, I haven't seen it. Is it with the same characters? Or the same house? Or something different but similar? <|endoftext|> Different story line with same characters <|endoftext|> Oh cool, I think I will watch that then! Do you know where it's available to watch? Online or in theaters? <|endoftext|> you can watch IT 2 online, and that's awesome <|endoftext|> Great! I haven't seen that either, but I should. <|endoftext|> yeah more than the first one i love the part 2 <|endoftext|> Really? Why's that? <|endoftext|> the movie was interesting and they show how pennywise was formed and how to get rid of him <|endoftext|> Hmm, sounds like it would be more interesting. I'll accept both your recommendations! <|endoftext|> great! See you later! <|endoftext|> Have a good one! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good Morning, How are things going with you today? <|endoftext|> good how are you? <|endoftext|> Doing great. Watched a lot of great movies this weekend. Which ones are some of your favorites? <|endoftext|> I am into funny movies...  do you have any suggestions of trailers to check out so I can go to the movies next week? <|endoftext|> I am into funny movies also, which is why I am suggesting maybe seeing a different genre. I have been to the movies recently and the comedy movie selection is poor. I would not want to see you waste your money. What about action movies? <|endoftext|> ok I would go see an action film <|endoftext|> I am also really into war movies that depict American History. How much do you know about Pearl Harbor? <|endoftext|> thanks for the help... that could b e a good option...  any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> I would recommend seeing Midway if you are into action/war movies. The movie does a great job at illustrating the attack on our country and Pearl Harbor. The actors in the movie are amazing as well. Perfect movie for a night out. <|endoftext|> ok I think that sounds great...  what is your favorite movie ever? <|endoftext|> My favorite movie ever is Saving Private Ryan. Midway is very much like this movie. <|endoftext|> ok great I love that movies as well. I accept your recommendation to see Midway. <|endoftext|> Awesome. What is your favorite movie of all time? <|endoftext|> for sound engineering I loved Fury... though a bit too violent... I also loved Inglorious Basterds but that was not really historically accurate ;-) <|endoftext|> Inglorious Basterds is a great movie as well. Have you ever seen American Sniper? <|endoftext|> yes  it was pretty awesome  Bradley Cooper was great <|endoftext|> Bradley Cooper did a great job playing the role of Chris Kyle. It is amazing to me how many tours in Iraq Chris did and the danger he faced, only to be killed by one of his own men domestically. <|endoftext|> yes that was sad... anyways thanks for the chat I am looking forward to seeing midway! <|endoftext|> You are going to love it! Have a great day <|endoftext|> bye have a great day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> are you interested in a movie? <|endoftext|> I love movies and I am looking for recommendations. <|endoftext|> what genre are you in the mood for? <|endoftext|> Well my favorite is probably horror but I don't care for gore. I also like drama but rarely romantic dramas. I really like gangster and war movies as drama examples. I also enjoy comedies but it's so hard to recommend a comedy. <|endoftext|> You will love QUOTATION_MARKShaun of the DeadQUOTATION_MARK. It is a horror comedy with comical gore. It is a very unique movie. There are not many like it! <|endoftext|> I love Shaun of the Dead. I like horror comedies. <|endoftext|> I see that you have already seen that movie and you enjoyed it. Would you like another recommendation? <|endoftext|> Absolutely. If you have other horror comedy recommendations I would love to hear them. I like Shaun of the Dead, Dead Alive, Dead Snow, House, etc. <|endoftext|> have you seen QUOTATION_MARKTucker and Dale vs. EvilQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I have and i love it as well. Any other horror comedies? <|endoftext|> Jennifer's Body? <|endoftext|> I remember the trailers for it but I'm not sure that I saw it. What is it about? <|endoftext|> it is about a newly possessed high school cheerleader turns into a succubus who specializes in killing her male classmates. <|endoftext|> That sounds very interesting. I can't remember the cast. Do you know who they are? <|endoftext|> The cast are Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, Johnny Simmons, Adam Brody. An amazing cast! <|endoftext|> That is a very good cast. Did you really enjoy it? <|endoftext|> YES i enjoyed it! It was very funny and engaging! The movie won 3 awards <|endoftext|> Oh wow. I will definitely watch that one. You've provided a great recommendation. <|endoftext|> I am glad to have helped! <|endoftext|> You have. Thank you so much. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the movie trailer ? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I am doing great . <|endoftext|> Nice! Looking for some good movie recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yes I am. <|endoftext|> Well you have come to the right place. What type of movies are you in the mood to see? <|endoftext|> I'm in the mood for Christmas horror movies and action. <|endoftext|> I like you style! Are there any xmas horror or action movies that you have seen in the past that you really liked? <|endoftext|> Yes. Hobbes&Shaw,  Krampus, a Christmas Nightmare,  and Silent Night Deadly Night. <|endoftext|> Nice! Krampus and Christmas Nightmare are some of my favorites.A nightmare before Christmas is a solid Disney classic if you have never seen it. If you want scarier (that's not animated), go for Jack Frost. For action (and christmas) If you haven't seen Die Hard (there is also a second one), you should for sure start there. It's a classic and one of my favorites all time. <|endoftext|> I will definately watch a Nightmare Before Christmas and Jack Frost. I have already seen die hard. Yet I must leave since I am about to go out and pick up some DVD's. <|endoftext|> Sweet! I hope you enjoy them as much as I do. Don't get too scared ;) <|endoftext|> Oh I will enjoy them since this is how I celebrate christmas. Do you have any other Christmas horror movie reccomendations? <|endoftext|> My personal favorite is QUOTATION_MARKFollow.QUOTATION_MARK I love the cast and it's definitely a good thriller that keeps your heart racing for a majority. <|endoftext|> What  was your experience with QUOTATION_MARKFollowQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> I saw it a few years ago back when it first came out and watch it every December. I think I enjoy it because the characters are relatable and the story line has some normalcy to it, but it's high intensity and is in the spirit of Christmas time so also adds to the effect. <|endoftext|> If you watch it every December, then I am really excited to see it since for me Christmas is all about the movies . <|endoftext|> Oh hands down! I believe it's on Amazon Prime now, but I still watch on the original DVD like a movie nerd lol. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> I  prefer original DVD's  rather than streaming or downloadable mediums. <|endoftext|> Same! Not too many people like us out there anymore! I really hope you enjoy your movie watching :) <|endoftext|> Oh that is for sure. The local shop I buy CD's and records from is where I purchase most of my DVDs, and I also enjoy VHS tapes. <|endoftext|> That's awesome! I'm the same way and loveeee VHS tapes too. I'm so bummed my VCR broke a few months ago and finding a brand new one at a decent price is surprisingly difficult. Also side note, I know we are here for movies, but there is nothing like listening to a record on a chilly winter night. <|endoftext|> Have you considered asking for help at your local Makerspace to help repair your VCR? <|endoftext|> No! Great idea. There's a great little local shop downtown I love to go into, i'm going to bring it there. Good looking out thank you! I have to run but I hope you make it to the DVD store and enjoy those movies! Especially Follow, you should peep the trailer. Enjoy and have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. Do you know what genres you like? <|endoftext|> Great! Yes, I am looking for a movie recommendation. I typically enjoy dramas or indie films. <|endoftext|> That's great! What was the last one you saw that you liked? <|endoftext|> Hm, let's see. I saw Blinded By The Light and that was pretty enjoyable. <|endoftext|> I saw that as well and really enjoyed it. My family is really into Bruce Springsteen. Are you interested in seeing movies with songs or different ones? <|endoftext|> I enjoy movies with and without songs. I also saw The Farewell starring Awkwafina recently, which was good as well. <|endoftext|> I've seen the trailers for that movie, it looks really good. I really liked Awkwafina's work in Ocean's 8. Have you seen Book Smart? I think it might be a movie you enjoy <|endoftext|> I have not seen it yet, but I have heard of it and it does sound like something I would enjoy. <|endoftext|> I would reccomend you watch the movie Lady Bird. It stars Saoirse Ronan and was nominated for 5 Oscars. It's a coming of age movie taking place in the early 2000's. <|endoftext|> That sounds great! I'd love to see it. <|endoftext|> I remember you said you like indie and drama. This movie also has a bit of comedy. Do you also enjoy comedies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I enjoy some comedies. Mostly comedies with female leads. <|endoftext|> Then you will love this movie. It is centered around a 17 year old girl and her relationships with friends and family. Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes please! <|endoftext|> Great! It also stars Timoth\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffde Chalamet. Fun fact, Timoth\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffde Chalamet and Saoirse Ronan are also in the upcoming film Little Women together. Do you think you will see that movie when it comes out? <|endoftext|> You know, by golly, I just might! <|endoftext|> I think I will as well, I think me and you have very similar tastes in movies based on what you've told me so far. <|endoftext|> What a coincidence! But great minds think alike, they say. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Great! What type of movies would you recommend? <|endoftext|> Well there are many different types, what  type of movie trailers would you normally like to see? <|endoftext|> I love movies with a good story. I don't like horror or bloody movies. I enjoy comedies, dramas, and indies. <|endoftext|> Okay, what was the last movie you watched that you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed The Green Book. Such a good friendship story. <|endoftext|> Do you want to see a smiliar move to The Green Book, or something different? <|endoftext|> I am open to seeing almost anything that isn't grusome. <|endoftext|> One of my favorite movies is Forrest Gump, it is similar to The Green Book and won 6 Oscars! <|endoftext|> I do love that movie. Do you have any suggestions of a more recent movie? <|endoftext|> Bohemian Rhapsody is a recent move that is also criticallly acclaimed. <|endoftext|> That sounds good.I also enjoy biographies. Do you have any other movies that you would also recommend? <|endoftext|> Since you like biographical films, I watched the Imitation Game and it was an engaging story, with a very good cast. <|endoftext|> That sounds perfect! I do remember that the star was up for an Oscar? <|endoftext|> Yes, Benedict Cumberbatch was nominated for an Oscar for his  role in the movie but did not win. <|endoftext|> It sounds like something I would love to see. Do you have any other favorites that you have watched? <|endoftext|> One film which I don't see discussed often that I love is Whiplash, with J.K. Simmons. It tells the story of a Jazz student and his teacher, and their toxic relationship. <|endoftext|> I have not heard of it. It sounds interesting. I appreciate your insight! <|endoftext|> It has been my pleasure, I hope that you find something to your liking! <|endoftext|> I will check them out as soon as possible. Thank you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good, u? <|endoftext|> I'm doing good! I'm here to help you find a movie to watch. <|endoftext|> Any good drama? <|endoftext|> Okay, drama. Do you like comedy or action or romance kinda dramas? <|endoftext|> Romance or action <|endoftext|> Okay, do you usually prefer new movies or classics? <|endoftext|> definitely a new movie <|endoftext|> Gotcha. What about any good movies you watched recently? <|endoftext|> The Lighthouse and Once upon a time in Hollywood <|endoftext|> Any favorite actors or filmmakers? <|endoftext|> Matt Damon, Christian Bale <|endoftext|> Ah, a good pretty face is always nice. Do you want a sappy movie or a happy movie? <|endoftext|> True, and either sap or happy <|endoftext|> Have you seen Gravity? <|endoftext|> Yes, have another suggestion? <|endoftext|> Not quite a movie but I'd definitely suggest checking out the Outlander series at some point. <|endoftext|> Okay, how about a movie? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Sorry Angel? <|endoftext|> Have not heard of that, I'll watch it <|endoftext|> Sorry, it's not in the link list, I'm looking for a better option. How about The Aftermath? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you? <|endoftext|> Hey! I'm great, how about you? I am in the mood for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Great! I love movies! What is the latest movie you have watched? <|endoftext|> I watched Billy Madison while I was visiting my sister over Thanksgiving. <|endoftext|> I love that movie! Adam Sandler and Chris Farley are the best! What did you like about it and what did you not like about it? <|endoftext|> I also really like Adam Sandler, but not his newer movies. I liked that it was just silly funny. There was really nothing that I didn't like. <|endoftext|> Would you like a recommendation for a movie similar to that one? I also prefer old Adam Sandler movies. They were more light hearted and real! <|endoftext|> Yes, I really enjoyed it, so I would love something similar. <|endoftext|> Are you a Will Ferrell fan as well? I love his comedies and they can be kind of similar to old Sandler movies! <|endoftext|> I really don't like him. I know most people do, but he's not my jam. I kind of want an Adam Sandler one again. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Happy Gilmore? It is from the same time period as Billy Madison and is a laugh riot! <|endoftext|> YES, that is perfect!! I saw parts of it once at a party, but I couldn't remember what it was called! Thank you, I accept that recommendation! <|endoftext|> It is a great movie. A classic Adam Sandler movie. It almost makes you forget all the recent ones he has tried to do! <|endoftext|> Totally! Thanks, again! <|endoftext|> No problem! I always enjoy recommending movies. I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will! I've been trying to remember the name for a long time! <|endoftext|> It is the movie that I consider to be closest to Billy Madison. It should make you laugh and root for the underdog! A great combo of a movie. <|endoftext|> I love movies like that! I'm going to pop some popcorn! <|endoftext|> Awesome! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Thanks, I'm sure I will! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> Hello.

I like stuff like The Lighthouse. <|endoftext|> never seen it what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like horror movies that don't rely on jump scares. Movies like Hereditary or Midsommar come to mind. <|endoftext|> horror movies are great you should watch the island <|endoftext|> I've never heard of it. I'll watch it! <|endoftext|> so would you watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I will. <|endoftext|> cool its a great movie about a facility in the mid-21st century <|endoftext|> What year did it come out? <|endoftext|> July 11 2005 <|endoftext|> Oh, okay. I think this is the one based on the Aldous Huxley story. <|endoftext|> not sure about that <|endoftext|> If you like this movie, you should try watching Gattaca. <|endoftext|> seen it <|endoftext|> What did you think of it? <|endoftext|> was great <|endoftext|> Great. Well, thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> welcome <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello how are you today? <|endoftext|> Great, how are you? <|endoftext|> i am also well <|endoftext|> Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> i have seen a few, have you seen any you really liked? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I saw Ford v Ferrari last weekend, but I'm looking to see something tonight. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> what type of movies do you usually like to watch? <|endoftext|> I like more plot driven movies, not really into action movies <|endoftext|> ok, i saw one i really thought was amazing recently, have you heard of the movie Joker? <|endoftext|> Yeah I've heard of it. I thought about going to see that one but I wasn't sure. I really wanted to see Knives Out. What did you like about the Joker? <|endoftext|> even though it was a super hero character, it was nothing like a super hero movie. it was gritty a real. it is the story of how the joker became the joker because of many bad events over his life. <|endoftext|> So not a lot of fight scenes and big action movie stuff? <|endoftext|> no there are not very many fight scenes, it is mostly just about the joker himself <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting <|endoftext|> joaquin phoenix is perfect for the role and does an amazing job acting in it. <|endoftext|> Yes, he is a good actor. Do you know who directed it? <|endoftext|> yes the director was Todd Phillips. <|endoftext|> Didn't he do the Hangover? Thats a much different film! <|endoftext|> sorry i am not sure, but i think you will enjoy the Joker it all has an 8.9 rating on IMBD.com <|endoftext|> Thanks I think so too, I'll go check it out this weekend. Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi I'm looking for a great SCI FI Action movie <|endoftext|> hmmm what's one of your favorite sci fi movies you've watched? <|endoftext|> Pacific rim <|endoftext|> What did you like about it, the characters, the story lines, what stood out to you? <|endoftext|> The characters, actors, and story line was really enjoyable. The special effects were great as well. <|endoftext|> I agree, I really loved the ending to Pacific Rim. The characters were great. Are you familiar with the direct Guillermo Del Toro? <|endoftext|> Yes I am, he does some good movies. I'm looking for something new though in that style of movie. <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of creatures and aliens then? <|endoftext|> Both appeal to me a great deal! <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy the aliens that help humans or try to kill the human species, or even both? lol <|endoftext|> Both are great and I really enjoy. Also I especially enjoy if they have both in the movie as well.:) <|endoftext|> Me too! You have the good aliens and then the bad aliens that throw you through a ringer haha. What's your opinion on Robot movies? <|endoftext|> I do enjoy Robot movies, if the special effects are up to par for them. <|endoftext|> Did you watch Ex Machina? <|endoftext|> Yes I really enjoyed the movie. <|endoftext|> Yeah the 3D robots were done very well and the story line kept me super involved. I'm curious if you have also watched The Arrival? It's an alien one <|endoftext|> It really didn't get me, I preferred something like skyline or Battle for los angles <|endoftext|> I would bet you've already seen District 9 yeah? lol <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, interesting plot but I was hoping for more action. <|endoftext|> I'm noticing you really like the sci fi with that extra tough of action haha hmmmmm which means you've probably watch Aliens, and The Matrix, and all those goodies. How about the new Blade Runner movie? <|endoftext|> No I haven't seen that one yet, I'm hesitant because the new remakes break with established lore of the originals, such as Total recall.. <|endoftext|> Yeah that makes sense and I agree. Only one way to find out! lol Well I'm going to recommend that one and hopefully they have the trailer available for me to link sound good? <|endoftext|> Alright I'll try it, please give me the link <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey! I'm gonna try to find a movie trailer that you will enjoy for you. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like comedies! <|endoftext|> Awesome! I love comedies. What is one of your favorite comedies? <|endoftext|> I really like Monty Python and the Holy Grail. <|endoftext|> Great! Me too. One of my favorite movies is called What We do In the Shadows. It has similar humor to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The cast is from New Zealand instead of England though. <|endoftext|> That film sounds really interesting! Who directed it? <|endoftext|> It has two directors. Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi. It has the same people that were in the show Flight of the Concords. Did you happen to watch that show? <|endoftext|> Yes, I have watched the show! I really enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Great! Would you like to watch the movie trailer for What We Do In The Shadows? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would! <|endoftext|> I'm sorry. They actually don't have that mo <|endoftext|> Ok! Do you have other recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> How about the Kingsman? I think you might enjoy that. <|endoftext|> What is that about? <|endoftext|> It's about an English spy organization that recruits a street kid into it's high level, very competitive program. It's engaging, action packed but funny at the same time. It's a great film. <|endoftext|> Hm, I'm not sure. Any other comedies? <|endoftext|> My favorite comedy is Bridesmaids. About a bunch of women getting ready for a friends wedding. Very funny. <|endoftext|> That sounds really funny! What year was it made? <|endoftext|> It was from 2011 <|endoftext|> That sounds like a good movie. I think I will accept your recommendation and watch Bridesmaids! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> Can I help you with a suggestion of a movie? <|endoftext|> sure, what movie do you plan to reccomend? <|endoftext|> Well I'm wondering what kinds of films you like? <|endoftext|> I like good films, lol, on genre I am very open minded as long as the film is well made. I prefer comedies, action, adventures, good dramas and scyfy work for me too <|endoftext|> Ok I see. Would you say the plot is most important, or filming style, or other details? <|endoftext|> I think the overall feel of a movie, so while the plot is important, how the movie tell the story of the plot and the manner in which is present the story is what makes a good or bad movie <|endoftext|> I see. What's the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Well, there is titanic on TV right now <|endoftext|> I have one film in mind that's won several awards and has an exciting plot, with drama and action. It's called San Andreas <|endoftext|> what is it about? <|endoftext|> It tells the dramatic story of the aftermath of an earthquake <|endoftext|> when was it made? and what kind of award did it win? <|endoftext|> It was filmed in 2015 and won awards for outstanding visual effects! <|endoftext|> hmm, sounds interesting, I have not seen this movie before, do you have any other reccomendation? <|endoftext|> Well if you feel like something more in the thriller/drama category, Manhattan Night is a crime drama you might enjoy <|endoftext|> hm, crime drama is not something I usually prefer over action and drama. I guess if I have to choose between etiher I would go with your first reccomendation <|endoftext|> Got it, alright! Is there another style you would enjoy more? <|endoftext|> I prefer comedy and action a bit more, but I think I would take your reccomendation on San Andreas, it sounds like a movie worth watching, thank you <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help you pick a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi that's great I'm considering seeing a new horror movie. Do you have anything in mind? <|endoftext|> Got it. This will help me give you some to choose from. <|endoftext|> I look forward to your ideas. I'm not sure what's coming up. <|endoftext|> I can guarantee that if you love horror you'll definitely want to see QUOTATION_MARKIt TwoQUOTATION_MARK. I saw it and it was creepier than the first. Anoter one is QUOTATION_MARKScary Stories to Tell in the DarkQUOTATION_MARK. Equally scary.QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I saw It Chapter Two and liked it. What can you tell me about QUOTATION_MARKScary Stories to Tell in the DarkQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> This is a neat adaptation of all of the  types of scary stories most of us have heard when we were younger like the scarecrow that comes to life, lovers being stalked while making out in lover's lane, etc. The director gave it a more adult take with lot's of fright. <|endoftext|> I've seen alot of remakes of classic scary stories. For example, the scarecrow as depicted in QUOTATION_MARKJeepers CreepersQUOTATION_MARK. Do you think this movie Scary Stories would be different? <|endoftext|> It is somewhat different because it takes the stories to a deeper level. I think you would enjoy this move. Another one I saw was QUOTATION_MARKReady or NotQUOTATION_MARK which was a comedic take on horror. If you want horror with comedy this one is worth the ticket. If you're like me, the unexpected fright that you don't see coming is the best! <|endoftext|> Can you send me the trailer for the Scary Stories movie you recommend? <|endoftext|> I'll be happy to send it to you. Enjoy. <|endoftext|> Thank you so much! <|endoftext|> My pleasure to help you with your choices. <|endoftext|> I look forward to seeing it! <|endoftext|> There are so many horror movies being released compared to years ago and, happily, the quality has improved. As a horror fan. myself. I'm thrilled. <|endoftext|> A horror movie will make or break within the first 15 minutes or so for me. I never finish movies for the sake of it but I'm also fairly forgiving about cliche. <|endoftext|> I agree. If I'm not starting to stress during that time or at least become aware that somethings coming then I've tuned out. <|endoftext|> I can recognize traditional scare tactics pretty well in this genre. If you have seen enough of them, it gets that way. <|endoftext|> The very best film that I believe captured your total attention at the beginning was QUOTATION_MARKQuietQUOTATION_MARK. Totally fantastic and unique take on horror. <|endoftext|> I don't think I've ever seen that one. <|endoftext|> Pllease do yourself a favor and catch this one. You will love it. Totally engaging with John Krasinski as the star. He also wrote the story. Oh, the full title is QUOTATION_MARKA Quiet PlaceQUOTATION_MARK. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm Claire and I'm here to help you find a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Great, what kind of movies would you recommend? <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you tend to like? <|endoftext|> I don't have a genre I like specifically. I just prefer movies that are critically acclaimed. <|endoftext|> OK, what was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I just watched Booksmart. <|endoftext|> Did you like it? <|endoftext|> Yes, it was good <|endoftext|> What did you like most about it? <|endoftext|> It was really well written and the cast was really good. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Lady Bird? <|endoftext|> I have. It was very good. It is something I would watch again. Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> Do you prefer the humor or the deeper story? <|endoftext|> I don't really have a preference. I like both. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Dope? It's got a similar theme of a teen coming of age, except in this case he lives in a tough neighborhood and gets caught up in an adventure. <|endoftext|> No. I have never heard of that movie. Do you know who is in it? <|endoftext|> ASAP Rocky, Blake Anderson, Bruce Beatty... no really big stars, but it won 6 awards and is highly critically acclaimed <|endoftext|> Cool, I will definitely check it out. <|endoftext|> Great, I hope you like it! <|endoftext|> Me too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey what's up? Looking for a movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, something with denzel washington maybe <|endoftext|> Hmm, Denzel huh? I remember him in Remember the Titans and in the Bone Collector. I think that one is getting a remake into a series. What's your favorite Denzel movie? <|endoftext|> The equalizer, loved him in Remember the titans. I forgot he was in that one <|endoftext|> Equalizer, I think I remember that. He was kind of a guy that stood up for the little guy, right? vigilante justice? You like more action movies or the drama in general? <|endoftext|> I love action movies for sure and yes it was really good. The second one was even better <|endoftext|> You ever seen Training Day? <|endoftext|> Ahh yes, I forgot he was in that too lol <|endoftext|> ... but not the hero...  kind of a twist for him. So what's the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Just rewatched some Star Wars movies because I watched The Mandalorian <|endoftext|> Nice, maybe Denzel can be Baby Yoda's voice when he learns to talk.... so action action action, Denzel is a plus, but nothing boring or slow. Got it <|endoftext|> Anything with Jason Mamoa   =) <|endoftext|> Got It <|endoftext|> Would like to see the new Terminator <|endoftext|> Terminator: Dark Fate? <|endoftext|> Yes that's the one. I heard Arnold will be in this one too <|endoftext|> Did you get the trailer? <|endoftext|> No but I accept the recommendation <|endoftext|> ... of course, obvious is Rise of Skywalker coming out too.... <|endoftext|> Yes, my husband wants to see that bad <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi how are you <|endoftext|> Good how about yourself? <|endoftext|> doing good what kind of movie are you looking for today? <|endoftext|> I would like to see a comedy movie <|endoftext|> do you like newer or oldermovies? <|endoftext|> I like newer movies for sure. <|endoftext|> any specific actors that you like? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I think Will Ferrell is funny <|endoftext|> is there a preference on the rating?does it need to be kid appropriate <|endoftext|> No it does not need to be kid friendly at all <|endoftext|> Holmes & Watson came out in 2018 and has Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Rebecca Hall, Rob Brydon <|endoftext|> That seems like a really good suggestion, I accept that suggestion. <|endoftext|> the plot of the movie is A humorous take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic mysteries featuring Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson. <|endoftext|> How long is the movie? <|endoftext|> it s 90 mins <|endoftext|> Oh that's not a lot of time. It doesn't need to be kid friendly, but can I show it to kids? <|endoftext|> it is rated pg 13 <|endoftext|> Have you personally seen this movie? <|endoftext|> no  have not but it looks like one i would enjoy watching. <|endoftext|> Well then, that's the one I shall try out and watch. Thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today? <|endoftext|> Hello..I am doing well <|endoftext|> Great, I am currently in the midwest dealing with a snow storm. You dealing with any snow? <|endoftext|> Yes.I live in North East.snow just started. excepting more in coming days <|endoftext|> While I am dealing with the snow I am definately going to be watching movies. How about you? Do you plan to watch some movies? <|endoftext|> I used to watch movies. I mostly watch my regional movies.. <|endoftext|> Awesome, tell me about these regional movies, are they mostly about the USA and/or about the East Coast? <|endoftext|> No. This is not about the states. This is other country movies.But i used to watch most engish movies in states <|endoftext|> I see, do you like more drama or action? <|endoftext|> I like action movie.Recently i watched ford vs ferrari movie..I liked it..how about your recent movie experience? <|endoftext|> My last movie was Hobbs & Shaw, it was pretty cheesy but my daughters loved it. I want to see Ford Vs Ferrari. Do you like mob movies and thrillers? <|endoftext|> I always like thriller movies..I like to watch.I was searching  for thriller movies in netflix and prime.. <|endoftext|> I think a great netflix movie is the QUOTATION_MARKThe Irishmen.QUOTATION_MARK Its directed by Martin Scorses and has the best actors as gangsters, like Robert Denior, and Al Pacino. I strongly recommend it. <|endoftext|> I appreciate your suggestion. I would love to watch over the weekend..Do you like to watch any international movies? <|endoftext|> yes, I do. I like <|endoftext|> I would suggest you to watch bollywood movies..You would like it <|endoftext|> I think I am more into Itallian movies like QUOTATION_MARKThe PostmanQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKLife BeautifulQUOTATION_MARK.

I will watch them.wat kind of music do you like? <|endoftext|> I like Jazz and Folk, but always listen to Pop and Rock. Yourself? <|endoftext|> I like more of western styles as well as some my traditional music.. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! I would like to help you find a movie to watch. <|endoftext|> I am always looking for some good horror movies. <|endoftext|> What type of horror movies do you enjoy? Bloody or supernatural? <|endoftext|> Both really. As long as it actually has a fairly good plot. For instance, I really enjoyed the first Saw movie but then they got kind of ridiculous. <|endoftext|> What is the last horror movie you watched recently? <|endoftext|> The Orphanage <|endoftext|> That's a good one. What was your favorite part of the movie? <|endoftext|> I liked the twist ending, how he was left in the closet all along. I enjoy surprises like that (kind of like Saw at the end). <|endoftext|> The Saw series are one of my favorites, to be honest. I always like surpise endings. <|endoftext|> I also really liked The Descent and the sequel. <|endoftext|> I have found a movie. I think you would really enjoy watching QUOTATION_MARKBird BoxQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Okay, I actually saw a trailer and it looked interesting and I would like to watch it so I'll accept that. <|endoftext|> It has twists and a plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat I think. <|endoftext|> Sounds good! <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy Sandra Bullock movies in general? <|endoftext|> I do! I really like her! <|endoftext|> She is a wonderful actress and has starred in some great movies. <|endoftext|> Yep. Go ahead and select Bird Box and I'll accept it.=) <|endoftext|> ok! Have a wonderful day <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey its, Kiki how are you?? <|endoftext|> Hello Kiki! I am well, you? <|endoftext|> I am well thank you. So I am looking to go to the movies and I need something new. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> My favorites are b horror comdies from at least 30 years ago <|endoftext|> Like Rocky Horror Picture Show?? <|endoftext|> That is one of my favorites lol I really like movies like Bad Biology and Braindead <|endoftext|> I like that movie too. Tell me what else have you seen <|endoftext|> I love Frank Henenlotter flicks, pretty much anything along those lines <|endoftext|> I will have to check him out. So, outside of B movie horror what else do you like to watch <|endoftext|> I suppose I sometimes like QUOTATION_MARKfeel goodQUOTATION_MARK movies but pretty much everything I watch is along some weird eclectic line. I recently Bad Taste and it blew my mind I hadn't seen it before. <|endoftext|> I think I can recommend something you may like <|endoftext|> I look forward to it! :D <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen the Purge it is not a feel good but you make like it <|endoftext|> I watched like half of it but I'll give it another try if you recommend it. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> You will like it. It is a bit campy with some funny but totally unrealistic <|endoftext|> Oh lawd I hope it's Cabin in the Woods campy XD <|endoftext|> Not like that but that is a good movie. <|endoftext|> I will give it one more try just because you said so :P thank you for your recommendation <|endoftext|> You are welcome <|endoftext|> I feel like I'm going to get to the exact same point in the movie and then wonder why I decided to try it again when I knew it was junk to begin with lol I won't curse you, promise hahaha <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing really good. How are you? <|endoftext|> Great, thanks for asking! I hope I can find you a good movie trailer. Do you know what kind of movie you'd like to see? <|endoftext|> I like romantic comedies best, but I also like movies based on true events. <|endoftext|> What was the last romantic comedy you watched? <|endoftext|> The Wedding Singer, with Adam Sandler. He's one of my favorites. The music is always great in his movies. <|endoftext|> Cool! Haven't seen that one in forever. So are you looking for something similar? <|endoftext|> Yes! I like that endearing hopefulness, with the really sweet, good guy. You know the kind, where love just sort of sneaks up on them! <|endoftext|> Do you like Ben Stiller or Cameron Diaz? <|endoftext|> I like them both! They both seem to have very sweet character portrayals. <|endoftext|> If you haven't seen There's Something About Mary, I highly recommend it. It stars them both and it's really funny, some of the jokes can be a little bit dirty though. I can tell you more about it if you'd like. <|endoftext|> I've heard some really good reviews about that one. I'd love to hear more about it. And I don't mind some of the dirty jokes, in the interest of comedy--I'll just be sure to watch it after the kids have gone to bed. I accept this recommendation. Tell me more about it, please. <|endoftext|> Ben Stiller was a bit of a dork in high school and manages to get a prom date with a really attractive girl (Diaz), however the date goes awry in hilarious fashion. Years later he gets a chance to meet up with her again and kind of start over. Lots of complications though and the way he goes about it is kinda dodgy, but his heart is true. <|endoftext|> So is the attractive girl nice or antagonistic in this movie? Does she seem to like Ben or does she treat him as though he's beneath her level. <|endoftext|> She's actually super sweet and part of the reason she liked Ben's character in the beginning is because he had a sweet heart and got along well with her special needs brother. She's a bit of a guy's girl when she's older, into sports, beer, etc... <|endoftext|> Cool--sounds interesting. I'd love to watch it. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> There's also a little band that sort of breaks the third wall and plays throughout the story, I always thought that was kind of neat. The supporting cast is really good too, Matt Dillon and Lee Evans have great side characters competing for Mary's affection. Great, I'll link the trailer is just a moment. <|endoftext|> Okay--I'll wait. I do enjoy a story that has little sidelines in it! <|endoftext|> The band sort of lightly chronicles the story so far. Anyway, the trailer should be on the way after this. I hope you enjoy the film. Take care. <|endoftext|> Thanks. You, too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I am here to recommend a movie to you! <|endoftext|> Hi I am looking for a good action comedy I am getting sick of the holiday movies already! <|endoftext|> I don't blame you! Do you like satirical super-heros? Deadpool might be just the thing for you. <|endoftext|> I am not into the super heros movies- my husband is. Got any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> If you enjoy British comedy, Hot Fuzz is hilarious. <|endoftext|> British comedies I love like Red Dwarf! I have not heard of Hot Fuzz before- when was it released? <|endoftext|> 2007 It has Simon Pegg in it and he is absolutely great. <|endoftext|> Is that Simon PEgg of Shaun of the dead? <|endoftext|> Yes! <|endoftext|> Oh my gosh I am totally putting Hot Fuzz on my list to watch- I will have to check if it is on Netflix or Hulu if not I think it will be worth renting from Amazon! <|endoftext|> Apparently M Turk doesn't have Hot Fuzz when I search, lol, but at least you can look for it on your own. Have you seen Zombieland? <|endoftext|> Yes we just went to Zombieland 2 in the theater over the weekend. Another favorite of mine! Woody Harrelson is great <|endoftext|> Dang, can't pick one you already saw. I just need to find one that M Turk has in their search bar, lol, sucks they don't have Hot Fuzz, I have no idea why. <|endoftext|> I will find that one. But I accept the recommendation for Hot Fuzz <|endoftext|> I don't think I can do a recommendation since it's not listed in their search bar. I have to do a search and then pick from their listed movies.:( <|endoftext|> ahhh got it- Then I can accept Zombieland <|endoftext|> Got it! Thanks, lol, I hope you enjoy Hot Fuzz though, it's really great! <|endoftext|> I definately will! OK now where do we end this it says  4. If you accept your partner's recommendation, let your partner know through the chat. Then, click QUOTATION_MARKAcceptQUOTATION_MARK after both of you are DONE with the chat. <|endoftext|> I selected Zombieland so hopefully you see that? <|endoftext|> nope <|endoftext|> I don't have any other buttons... hmmm, it says it's selected. <|endoftext|> Done appeared now for me!

Have you seen the trailer for the Sonic the Hedgehog movie? <|endoftext|> No not yet. Is it a good movie? <|endoftext|> It's definitely a super cute choice if you enjoy those, I enjoyed it <|endoftext|> Ok thanks I'm going to check it out <|endoftext|> I would also suggest you might like The New Mutants, the latest x-men movie coming out <|endoftext|> Ok thanks for the recommendations. I'll accept both <|endoftext|> Okay perfect. Do you like watching your movie alone or with friends? <|endoftext|> I usually watch alone unless friend's are really interested.

I like all sort of films not just Fantasy.

Let it go i still sing the song when i am playful. <|endoftext|> Yeh! i felt the same was not so interesting as Part 1. It was a little flop. <|endoftext|> I think Pixar will make us laugh again with the new onward movie. it got all the spices of frozen one and it has a stellar cast also. i recommend you take a look at the trailer <|endoftext|> Sure i will try to watch that movie with my friends.I like to do  gardening during my free hours. <|endoftext|> Even me i have a vegetable garden in our back yard.

Have you? <|endoftext|> Yes, it is so awesome! <|endoftext|> Anything in particular you liked about it? <|endoftext|> I liked that it was fully actions packed from the beginning to the end. It kept me on the edge of my seat. What did you like about it? <|endoftext|> Same here. I love all will smith movies usually! <|endoftext|> I agree... the next movie I would like to see would be Queen and Slim. It's action, drama and romance rolled all into one film. Have you heard of this movie? <|endoftext|> I've heard of it, but I'm not sure if I want to watch it. Any other movies you might think are good? <|endoftext|> Have you seen After Earth? <|endoftext|> I have not! What is the movie about? <|endoftext|> It is an action adventure.

Speaking of historical movies...have you ever seen Rosewood? <|endoftext|> I haven't. To be honest, I haven't gotten a chance to see many movies lately! What is it about? <|endoftext|> It's an older movie, but it is heart wrenching. It is an historical, action packed film about a town that was pretty much destroyed due to a lie that was told. Very emotional and based on a true story. Would you like to see the trailer for this film? <|endoftext|> No I'm good. I'm not interested! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, do you like Movies? <|endoftext|> hi! I do this time of year I love Christmas themed movies.

I also like stoner comedies. <|endoftext|> I also love stoner comedies! I think my favorite recently would have to be The Interview with James Franco and Seth Rogan <|endoftext|> Oh! I've seen advertisements for that one, but forgot all about it. Is it available for streaming yet I wonder? I love Seth Rogan in everything he does! Pineapple Express was great! <|endoftext|> It is! It is streaming on Amazon Prime Video. It has so much of the classic Seth Rogan humor in it and adds a light hearted take on the whole North Korean situation. It is definitely a watch over and over again movie. I've seen it four times! <|endoftext|> This is a perfect recommendation. I'm going to put it on right now! Thank you so much for a great movie recommendation! <|endoftext|> No Problem! I hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|> Thanks! I am excited to see how it is. I like James Franco a lot, too. But I've only seen him in more serious roles. <|endoftext|> I was the same way, but I feel like after this movie he should really move into more comedic roles. He was outstanding. But you could truly see the friendship that him and Seth have on and off the camera. They played off of each other very well <|endoftext|> That's awesome to hear. I'm pulling it up right now. I'm ready to settle in with some laughs for a while. <|endoftext|> Oh you will definitely laugh throughout the movie. It is so hilarious! <|endoftext|> That's good. I need it after the last movie I watched. The - Report. OMG, it was so boring! <|endoftext|> Oh I completely agree that movie was not very interesting got me at all. I just cannot get into the drama movies. I am more of a Comedy/Horror movie person <|endoftext|> It sounds like we have similar taste in movies. A fun zombie movie is Fido. I'm not sure if you've seen it, but it's comedy and zombie. I love it! <|endoftext|> I have not, I will definitely have to check that out as well! <|endoftext|> I think you will enjoy it,. It's light hearted and funny. <|endoftext|> Awesome thanks so much that sounds great! <|endoftext|> No problem. I hope that you enjoy it. I've finally got the movie loaded up! <|endoftext|> Great!

What was the last horror movie you watched that you enjoyed the most? <|endoftext|> Annabelle Comes Home <|endoftext|> what did you like most about Annabelle Come Home, and what did you dislike the most? <|endoftext|> I liked how the girl wanted to find out if the house was haunted but shen she did, she was scared and didn't want to know anymore. <|endoftext|> Okay, so would you like a movie with a similar story, or a different one? <|endoftext|> Similar story is better. <|endoftext|> The Nun <|endoftext|> I've never seen it. Is it really scary? <|endoftext|> It's pretty scary, would you like to know a little bit more about the movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would. <|endoftext|> Awesome! A priest with a evil past, and a novitiate on the brink of her final vows are sent to investigate the suicide of a young nun in romania. When they uncover the unholy secret, they risk there lives, soul, and there faith as they confront a malevolent force in the shape of a demonic nun. <|endoftext|> This movie sound awesome. Thank you. <|endoftext|> would you like to know the actors/actresses as well? <|endoftext|> No, that's it. <|endoftext|> Awesome, so would you like to watche the trailer then? <|endoftext|> No thank you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello how are you <|endoftext|> good...waited awhile i almost left thinking there was an error <|endoftext|> it does take its time, <|endoftext|> so what do you have to recommend? <|endoftext|> do you have any particular type of movies you like? <|endoftext|> mostly comedies....some thrillers or drama. I just saw Captain Marvel with the woman.....it was ok...my other half liked it better than me :) <|endoftext|> which comedy would you recommend? <|endoftext|> an old one is bridesmaids....love that movie :) <|endoftext|> Have you seen number Two? <|endoftext|> no..what is that about <|endoftext|> no sorry 27 dresses, have you seen it <|endoftext|> i think so...i remember my daughter liked it alot, i believe i saw it with her once... <|endoftext|> Its about a women who was a bridesmaid for 27  times <|endoftext|> yes i do remember that one. I also just saw Yesterday...loved it since it had beatles songs :) <|endoftext|> Did you watch crazy rich asians? <|endoftext|> NO i havent...but i heard the name, is it good? <|endoftext|> Its been compared to Bridesmaid you should check it out <|endoftext|> ok i think i will :) <|endoftext|> it has really good ratings on rotten tomatoes <|endoftext|> i will read them and give it a try. thank you! <|endoftext|> any time it is a good film <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm fine thanks. How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. I'm going to try to help you find a cool movie today. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I love romantic comedies <|endoftext|> Romantic comedies are awesome! Have you ever seen 500 Days of Summer? <|endoftext|> Yeah. It was alright <|endoftext|> That's one of my favorites. Which one is your current favorite? <|endoftext|> We're the millers <|endoftext|> I love Jennifer Aniston! Have you seen The Switch? <|endoftext|> The switch was fantastic. Jenniefer was a revelation <|endoftext|> I totally agree. I love Jason Bateman too, he's such a dad and absolutely hilarious. Have you seen Juno? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one. What's it about? <|endoftext|> It came out in like 2007 so it's a little older but it's about this teenage girl who accidentally gets pregnant by one of her best friends, and then how she deals with the aftermath of that. I don't want to spoil it and I know it sounds cheesy but it's actually really sweet and super funny and not at all what you would probably expect out of a teen pregnancy movie. <|endoftext|> I'd really like to see it. It sounds interesting <|endoftext|> Awesome! If you decide to watch it I hope you like it! <|endoftext|> Do you have any other suggestion? <|endoftext|> I also really like Crazy Stupid Love because Im a big Steve Carrell fan! It's about a guy having a sort of mid-life crisis after a divorce. <|endoftext|> I've watched it. My girlfriend has a crush on Steve Carrell from his performance in that movie. <|endoftext|> Haha, your girlfriend and I have that in common. Steve Carrell is the best. So if you're interested, I can try to send you the movie trailer from Juno! <|endoftext|> I'd like that very much. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I understand you like movies! <|endoftext|> Yes, what is a comedy movie you would recommend? <|endoftext|> Do you like romantic comedies, slapstick, or comedies with a good story? <|endoftext|> Romantic or with a good story! I like witty humor. <|endoftext|> Do you like old classic films that may be in black and white or do you prefer newer works? <|endoftext|> I prefer newer works. <|endoftext|> OK one of the really good new ones is called Longshot. Have you heard of it? <|endoftext|> No, what is it about? <|endoftext|> It is a classic formula of two people from different worlds finding each other. What is interesting is the actors. Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron. Not two people you would tend to see in a movie together <|endoftext|> I guess that's why it's called QUOTATION_MARKLongshotQUOTATION_MARK. I'm not sure I am interested. <|endoftext|> One from earlier this year was Always Be My Maybe. About two people whose paths crossed over the years but they never got together as the timing was always wrong and their destinies took them different places <|endoftext|> That one sounds more interesting. <|endoftext|> Cool, one of my favorites this year was Murder Mystery with Jennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler. The formula is the stale couple rekindling their romance but it takes place on a yacht and a murder takes place and they find themselves in the middle of trying to solve it while working out their relationship issues. <|endoftext|> I can't stand Adam Sandler movies... which is unfortunate because I love Jennifer Aniston. <|endoftext|> Well this one is a bit different but depends on whether you like Rebel Wilson or not. She stars as a person who hates Rom Coms, gets knocked and finds herself living the plot of a Rom Com. Learning life lessons and finding love along the way. <|endoftext|> I think she is a bit overrated. I need a witty movie! <|endoftext|> OK I am going to reach back here. John Cusack stars as a professional hit man who walked out on his girlfriend just before senior prom and returns 10 years later for the reunion and to try and get back together with his girlfriend Minnie Driver. He is also trying to reconcile his job with trying to have a normal life. Grosse Point Blanke <|endoftext|> That sounds more interesting <|endoftext|> OK, another good one from a few years ago is Chasing Amy, a Kevin Smith film starring Ben Affleck about a comic book artist who falls in love with a woman who is currently living a lesbian lifestyle. Both discover a lot about themselves and has a lot of Kevin Smith type humor in it. <|endoftext|> I think I will go with Grosse Point Blanke. <|endoftext|> Thanks, here is the trailer! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I am here to help recommend a movie for you today. <|endoftext|> Great! I am looking for psychological thrillers, do you know of any good ones? <|endoftext|> I know of some really great ones. Have you ever seen Donnie Darko? <|endoftext|> I have not! But have definitely heard of it before. I'll definitely have to check that one out, but am curious if you know of any more recent films? <|endoftext|> What about the movie QUOTATION_MARKGet Out!QUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> I have been meaning to watch that one, actually. I will accept that recommendation! Thank you <|endoftext|> Awesome! Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, sure! <|endoftext|> Great. The trailer should begin after the chat is finished. I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Ok, thanks again for the recommendation <|endoftext|> Before we finish, are there any other movies that you also be interested in? There are a few others in the thriller category that I think that you would like. <|endoftext|> Sure, I am open to more ideas! <|endoftext|> There was a fairly recent one that came out called Split, which also had a sequel called Glass. Have you heard of either of these? <|endoftext|> I haven't. What are they about? <|endoftext|> Split is based on the idea that a man kidnaps three girls, but the kicker is that he has 23 unique personalities. And apparently there is a 24th personality that is really horrible that has yet to come out yet. So the girls try to escape before the 24th comes out. <|endoftext|> Oh wow! That sounds creepy and definitely thrilling. What about Glass? <|endoftext|> Its the sequel to Split, and focuses on the 24th personality being used as a weapon. <|endoftext|> Both of those seem like movies I would be interested in. One of my favorite psychological thrillers is Shutter Island. Do you know of any movies similar to that? <|endoftext|> You might like Awaken, though it is a few years old. The plot is based on a random group of people waking up on an island where they are being hunted down. <|endoftext|> Great! I will have to check that one out too <|endoftext|> I think all of them are good movies. If I had  to choose one, Get Out had the best reception among movie critics and won/was nominated for the most awards. Do you still want to see that trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes please. <|endoftext|> All right, I will queue it up and end the chat if that is alright with you. <|endoftext|> Perfect, thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Good, I am looking for a good movie to watch. Any suggestions? <|endoftext|> Sure! I'd love to help! What kind of genres are you interested in?? I saw a really good comedy just the other night! <|endoftext|> I am more an action or sci fi fan. <|endoftext|> Any specific actor you like to watch?? <|endoftext|> Not really , I like an interesting plot <|endoftext|> I was really impressed with the latest Terminator! Although they've made lots of them, they are always so intriguing to watch! <|endoftext|> I liked the first one but heard the latest one wasn't very good. I like James Bond, Jurassic Park , some Marvel <|endoftext|> What is the latest action movie you watched?? <|endoftext|> I watched Spiderman Far from Home <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch Max Steel movie trailer?? <|endoftext|> Sounds okay <|endoftext|> Would you like me to find another?? <|endoftext|> I will watch Max Steel <|endoftext|> Great! I bet you will really like it! It's both Sci-Fi & action! <|endoftext|> I hadn't heard of it but it sounds like my kind of movie <|endoftext|> It came out in 2016 and has Ben Winchell in it along with Josh Brener <|endoftext|> I am not familiar with the actors but as I said, I am more interested in the plot <|endoftext|> Well hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|> I think I will. Thanks very much <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie you may like. <|endoftext|> Hi! do you have any favorites you could recommend right off the bat? <|endoftext|> I would like to recommend frozen II if you like family movies. <|endoftext|> I don't have any children, so I'm not very interested in family movies <|endoftext|> What genre are you interested in? <|endoftext|> I like fantasy, sci-fi, and action <|endoftext|> What movies have you seen lately? <|endoftext|> I saw zombieland 2, and it was awesome! <|endoftext|> What is that about? <|endoftext|> it's about a bunch of people post-apocalypse just trying to survive and not get eaten by zombies <|endoftext|> Cool! That is quite the action packed movie! <|endoftext|> it really is! <|endoftext|> Do you like fast cars? <|endoftext|> they're okay <|endoftext|> How about Batman movies? There is a new Joker movie out. <|endoftext|> I love batman! that would be a great movie! <|endoftext|> Joker is an exciting movie about the demise of Joker as society is not treating him well. <|endoftext|> That sounds awesome, I already like the Joker and it would be cool to see more about his backstory. Thank you, I accept that recommendation and will see that movie! <|endoftext|> Great! Have fun watching it. <|endoftext|> Thank you, I will enjoy it just like I enjoyed the Dark Knight! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, how's it going? <|endoftext|> ok, how about you? <|endoftext|> Doing well, enjoying a bit of sunshine for once. <|endoftext|> Excellent - cloudy here, though <|endoftext|> Ok. Sorry to hear that. Good day to sit back and watch some movies though. What was the last one you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was The Green Book. Have you seen it? I really liked it. Do you have any recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> No, I have not seen that yet. Is that with Mahershala Ali? I am more of an action, suspense type of guy. The last movie I just seen was on Netflix, The Foreigner with Jackie Chan and Pierce Brosnan. I enjoyed it. <|endoftext|> Yes, it was. I like suspense, too. Can you recommend a good suspenseful movie for me? <|endoftext|> Sure. A movie I am going to check out tonight is The Hateful Eight. I have not seen that movie yet, have you? It's on Netflix as well. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it, but I'll check it out! Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> No problem. Looks interesting, old-western like. <|endoftext|> Quentin Tarantino plus Samuel Jackson sounds like a good combination. <|endoftext|> Definitely. I selected the trailer for you to check it out. <|endoftext|> I just did - looks great! <|endoftext|> Yeah, I don't think I've ever seen a Tarantino movie that does not have some type of twist. Always enjoy those type of films. <|endoftext|> Me too - the best one I've seen is in a movie called Remember <|endoftext|> Remember? Never seen that, who is in that one? <|endoftext|> Christopher Plummer - he's amazing! <|endoftext|> Ok, I will have to look that up because he is an amazing actor. The stuff I've seen him in, he always steals a scene or two. <|endoftext|> He does in this movie too :) <|endoftext|> Okay, definitely will check that out. Anyways, nice chatting with you and enjoy your day. Goodbye <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing good, how about yourself? <|endoftext|> Great! I hear you're looking for some movie recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yes I am! <|endoftext|> Perfect! What was the last movie you saw that you loved?! <|endoftext|> Inglorious Basterds. I watched that last night and I really loved it. <|endoftext|> Ohh that's a good one! What would you say your favorite genre of movies is? <|endoftext|> Any type of action film, something with a thick plot, or comedies. <|endoftext|> ahh i'm a big fan of action films too, so intense! I love all the Marvel movies too, do you? <|endoftext|> Marvel movies are great but honestly, I think they are a little overrated. I enjoy watching them, but I wouldn't personally go out of my way to watch one. <|endoftext|> haha makes sense! well I do have a few recommendations, although you may have seen some of them already! <|endoftext|> Please do go ahead and recommend some movies! <|endoftext|> all of the Bourne movies are amazing, starting with The Bourne Identity! and then Annihilation is super interesting and always kept me guessing <|endoftext|> Unfamiliar with Annihilation, but I like the title already! <|endoftext|> Sooo good! Natalie Portman is incredible in it and the end is such a plot twist <|endoftext|> Natalie Portman??? Okay, this might definitely be in my ball house <|endoftext|> Yay!! Would you like to watch the trailer!? <|endoftext|> I would, yes. <|endoftext|> Perfect, i'll send it over! <|endoftext|> Thank you! Can't wait to watch. <|endoftext|> Hope you enjoy!! <|endoftext|> Thank you for the great movie recommendation. I will be watching this in a few hours! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> hI <|endoftext|> How are you? <|endoftext|> doing great, You? <|endoftext|> I am well. Would you like a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> sure.. and thanks <|endoftext|> My pleasure. What genre of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> drama mostly. sci-fi , and horror. I loved the New Joker Movie. did you see that <|endoftext|> I loved that too! Is that the most recent movie you've scene? <|endoftext|> no I saw 1917 2 weeks ago <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that yet. What did you think? <|endoftext|> AMZ cinematography non-stop action and good story-line... I was impressed. <|endoftext|> That's good to hear. Normally, I'm not a war movie fan but I may have to check it out. I have a recommendation for you. I think you'll like Gone Girl if you like drama, mystery and a story that will keep you on your toes. <|endoftext|> whats it about? <|endoftext|> Here's some info: Plot:  With his wife's disappearance having become the focus of an intense media circus, a man sees the spotlight turned on him when it's suspected that he may not be innocent. Actors: Ben Affleck, Rosamund Pike, Neil Patrick Harris, Tyler Perry  Directors: David Fincher  Production: 20th Century Fox  Awards: Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 65 wins & 177 nominations. Ratings: Internet Movie Database: 8.1/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 87%, Metacritic: 79/100. Personally, I read the book first but the twists and turns are amazing. <|endoftext|> that sounds like something I would watch. I like the actors listed and the director has put out some humorous movies. Ill have to check out how well he directs a drama <|endoftext|> I didn't know he did comedies. Gone Girl is quite dramatic and Rosamund Pike does a stunning job. You'll see what I mean, it gets crazy! <|endoftext|> Ill check it out and thank you for the recommendation <|endoftext|> You're welcome. Enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> check out the joker you wont be disappointed <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello there <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> so like me do you like movies and what are your preferences too? <|endoftext|> Yes I love watching movies mostly would say I prefer action or comedy <|endoftext|> so what was the last movie you watched <|endoftext|> The Fast and Furious spinoff Hobbs and Shaw <|endoftext|> oh, that is a very nice movie, seen it couple of times, I can't get over the actions <|endoftext|> I enjoyed it, do you have any other recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> have you seen 6 undergrounds? <|endoftext|> No never even heard of it. Is it new? <|endoftext|> 2019 movie, starred Ryan Reynolds in it <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting I'll have to look into it. Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> so would you see the movie eventually? <|endoftext|> I will for sure, already looked it up. Thanks <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I will watch the trailer <|endoftext|> alright, thanks for your time. Bye <|endoftext|> Thank you, bye <|endoftext|> I am Mark by the way, enjoy the rest of your day. Bye <|endoftext|> Nice to meet you Mark Good chat. Bye <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> hi! <|endoftext|> What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i really like action/adventure movies, and i enjoy a good horror film too. do you have any suggestions? <|endoftext|> I did just watch a horror movie called Midsommar with some friends about a month ago, that one was super odd. You heard of it? <|endoftext|> i have, and i've seen it too! i agree, it was one of the strangest films i've seen in a long time. i appreciate the cinematography though. since i've seen it already, do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yeah that was a real weird experience with friends haha. Anyways, other ones I liked recently were Joker (though most people have seen that haha), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Oldie but that was great), No country for Old Men (Engaging to watch, interesting villain, and cinematography was good), and There will be Blood (super weird and quite good) <|endoftext|> ohh, you know what, i haven't seen Joker yet but i've really been wanting to! i've heard a lot of great reviews, and didn't it win some awards recently? No Country for Old Men is one i've been meaning to watch as well, thank you for the reminder, haha! <|endoftext|> Oh nice! Yeah, I was late to the Joker train but it's fascinating movie. I know that a lot of hype can bring people into movies with inflated expectations but I went in knowing as little as possible and it really was great. Awesome atmosphere and great acting. <|endoftext|> i try not to let the hype affect my expectations too much, but sometimes i can't help but hold a movie to a higher standard after a certain point. well, thank you for the suggestions, i'll definitely watch those when i get a chance! <|endoftext|> Nice :). Since you pointed out the cinemetography in midsommar (and watched it in the first place) I imagine you're the kind of person who'll appreciate both of them for that alone, not to mention the other good aspects <|endoftext|> oh yes, good cinematography combined with good acting are huge selling points for me when it comes to watching (and liking) a movie. <|endoftext|> Well they both have unusually great acting so that'll definitely be a plus for you. Joker's massively pushed forward by Phoenix's great acting. <|endoftext|> fantastic, that's really reassuring to hear! the last film i saw with Phoenix in it was Signs, and he was awesome in that as well. <|endoftext|> I'm not sure I've actually seen anything else he was in that I recognized at least haha. But I was thinking of looking up some other ones to see after this movie, though I got distracted and never followed through with that. Maybe now I'll remember :P <|endoftext|> oh, really? Signs is a great place to start.:) <|endoftext|> Heh, maybe I'll check that out too. We're both getting something out of this that way haha. <|endoftext|> yeah, a win-win! anyway, thanks again for your recommendations.:) <|endoftext|> No problem, hope that you have a good time off it and me as well :) <|endoftext|> thanks, you too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello there <|endoftext|> Hi , I am looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> great ! Let me help you. What type of movie you'd like to watch <|endoftext|> I like all kinds , but especially horror and Marvel <|endoftext|> Like me :) So, what is the latest movie did you watch ? <|endoftext|> I watched Joker the other night <|endoftext|> they got the Oscars too <|endoftext|> I liked it <|endoftext|> do you think that the Joker is better than Marvel characters ? <|endoftext|> It is more serious and better in some ways but I like the escapism of Marvel movies too <|endoftext|> like the Captain right ? <|endoftext|> Yeah, and Iron Man and most of the rest <|endoftext|> what about the captain marvel ? <|endoftext|> Not my favorite but it wasn't bad <|endoftext|> do you know the old version of the Captain Marvel ? <|endoftext|> No but I am not interested in older movies <|endoftext|> me too but you should see the difference. the older movies are like the comics but the new ones are commercialized <|endoftext|> I still prefer the production value of the new ones <|endoftext|> of course. it worths the efforst obviously. let me show you just a quick cap from an old trailer. just to emphasize my opinion <|endoftext|> Okay but I would like a recommendation of a current movie then <|endoftext|> it is the Adventures of Captain Marvel <|endoftext|> I am ready for a recommendation but make it a more recent movie if you can <|endoftext|> I'm sure you have watched it but I would say The Eternals <|endoftext|> I am not sure , what year is the movie from? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing fine. How are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great. Thank you for asking. So I hear your looking for a movie to see? <|endoftext|> Yes, I'd like to see a drama, but nothing too scary. <|endoftext|> What's your favorite drama or actor, it would help me narrow something down to help you better. <|endoftext|> I really like female lead actresses. I don't have a favorite necessarily <|endoftext|> please give me a moment to have a look at what we can recommend you. Thank you for your patience <|endoftext|> No problem. I understand. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Erin Brockvich with Julia Roberts? <|endoftext|> Yes, that's a good one. I'm looking for something a little more current. <|endoftext|> Have you considered the live action movie Mulan? <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great idea. Is it good for young kids? <|endoftext|> Yes it's a Disney film adaption of their animated movie. <|endoftext|> Wonderful. I'd love to see it. Thank you so much for your recommendation! <|endoftext|> One moment while I get the trailer up for you. <|endoftext|> I can't wait to see it. <|endoftext|> Alright it should be right up now. <|endoftext|> This looks like a great movie to take my family to see with me. Do you have any suggestions for something I could watch with my husband on a date? <|endoftext|> Hmm give me one moment to find something romantic for you both!:) <|endoftext|> Nothing too sappy though! <|endoftext|> Hmm maybe a romcom? <|endoftext|> That sounds good. My husband gets bored and falls asleep if the movie isn't funny or exciting. <|endoftext|> There is a upcoming movie called The Love birds, which is a romantic comedy. with  Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani <|endoftext|> What else is Kumail Nanjiani in? I know the name <|endoftext|> He's been in the big stick, Hot tub time machine 2, Men in black international. <|endoftext|> Okay. When is the movie out in theaters? <|endoftext|> Hmm sadly after rechecking it's going to DVD, I am sorry. Let me find something better for you. <|endoftext|> Okay. If you can't find a romance, we both enjoy drama and comedy as well. <|endoftext|> I have a movie in mind I'm just checking release dates at the moment please do bare with me. <|endoftext|> Absolutely. I'm in no rush. <|endoftext|> Robert Downy JR has a movie coming out based on the book Dolittle which may fit the bill? <|endoftext|> I like RDJ! I'd like to see the trailer please. <|endoftext|> Hmm this system is having a problem pulling that trailer for some reason. <|endoftext|> That's okay. What's new in theaters this week? <|endoftext|> There is a very small selection of trailers sadly. Though reviewing a different source, my boyfriends meds appears to be a romcom. There is a comedy here listed called QUOTATION_MARKLike a BossQUOTATION_MARK that is a comedy that I can show you? <|endoftext|> I'd like to see the trailer for Like a Boss. <|endoftext|> The Boyfriends meds is releasing Tomorrow, Here is the trailer. <|endoftext|> Okay, thanks for your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, Can I help you find a movie? <|endoftext|> sure, I want a new release that is a comedy or a drama <|endoftext|> Great! What kinds of movies did you like in the past? Any particular drama you watched and liked recently? <|endoftext|> I like something mysterious with a bit of love <|endoftext|> What do you mean by mysterious? <|endoftext|> kidnapping, killing, emotional drama <|endoftext|> OK, sounds good <|endoftext|> any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Do you like Ed Norton movies? He just had Motherless Brooklyn that was nominated for Oscar. It has some thrill to it and a very moving romantic sub-plot, as well as some interesting psychological aspects to it (the main character has a unique condition) <|endoftext|> sounds good <|endoftext|> So, yes, I recommend you try Motherless Brooklyn -- it seems to have all the things you are looking for (drama, a bit of love, and for sure a lot of mystery) and it was positively critically acclaimed <|endoftext|> thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> There are other movies with Ed Norton if you like him. My favorite is The Illusionist. Love plays a bigger role there and it has elements of a period drama with mystery as well. <|endoftext|> that sounds interesting <|endoftext|> Now, what comedies did you like? <|endoftext|> I likes There is something about Mary and Duece Bigelow, Male Gigolo <|endoftext|> so you like more sexy stuff, I suppose? <|endoftext|> I got that right <|endoftext|> Did you see The Amimal? <|endoftext|> no, I did not <|endoftext|> I think you might like it.It is with Rob Schneider and it is kind of QUOTATION_MARKgross-humored comedyQUOTATION_MARK that people who like Mary and Duece would appriciate <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hay! <|endoftext|> Hey!! <|endoftext|> Have you seen Call Of The Wild yet? or BOP? <|endoftext|> Nooo! I haven't even seen the trailers. I'm looking for more of a horror movie <|endoftext|> what's the latest horror movie you've seen? <|endoftext|> Wait was BOP QUOTATION_MARKbirds of preyQUOTATION_MARK? & Gretel & Hansel have you seen it? <|endoftext|> No lol. I feel like there are like 5 Hansel and Gretel re adaptions every year... <|endoftext|> Really this is the first one i've seen, it was alright tho i do want to watch Bop i didn't realize that was the Quinn movie <|endoftext|> do most horror films effectively scare you? <|endoftext|> Honestly not anymore. I haven't seen any in recent times that put fear in me a sadly <|endoftext|> not even the lastest Jordan Peele movie. i haven't seen it but I hear he's a pretty effective director. <|endoftext|> US ? I saw it, it was over hyped in my opinion in terms of horror but it was such a good movie overall. Worth a watch or two <|endoftext|> what about 'A Quiet Place'? I haven't seen that either put people couldn't stop talking about it when it came out. Basically what's been the best horror film in these 5 years for you lol? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it either but seems pretty good & honestly in the last 5 years i think greenroom <|endoftext|> Horror films are getting increasingly popular in film i noticed. Does it frustrate you that the Oscars are biased against it or do you not care lol. <|endoftext|> I'm looking for a cool comedy like seth rogan type of thing <|endoftext|> Gotcha. I seriously recommend that Good Boys movie that's back by Seth Rogan. Its Rated R starring three little boys and their antics. I think what's enjoyable about the movie is that it apologetically showcases the negative feelings people have for children. It's part of the funny for sure. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah i just recently saw it, it was awesome. & Honestly it kinds sucks that the Oscars are biased because of the  amount of people that love horror and everyone knows it's one of the biggest genres but at the same time oh well as long as the movies keep coming out and the people are making their money <|endoftext|> yeah it's obnoxious at this point. <|endoftext|> i don't think enough people care about it tho thats the sad part <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, how are you doing tonight? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well, how are you? <|endoftext|> I am doing good. Do you like to watch movies? <|endoftext|> I love to watch movies <|endoftext|> Me too. my favorite kinds are action and horror. Which do you like> <|endoftext|> I like action and gritty drama. Comedy is good too. <|endoftext|> Ok, do you like to watch mission impossible movies with Tom Cruise? <|endoftext|> Mission Impossible is good, but there are other movies I like more. <|endoftext|> ok. which movies are your favorite to watch? <|endoftext|> I like movies by Quentin Tarantino. Pulp Fiction is one of my favorites <|endoftext|> oh nice. I am guessing you like the Kill Bill movies. <|endoftext|> I do like the Kill Bill movies. Can you think of any other movies like those I might like? <|endoftext|> how about superhero movies like batman? <|endoftext|> Batman is a good choice. Which movie specifically? <|endoftext|> the dark knight rises? <|endoftext|> Perfect. The instructions say to let you know whether I accept your recommendation or not. So I accept your recommendation of The Dark Knight Rises <|endoftext|> ok perfect I will recommend that movie. <|endoftext|> Okay. I'll click QUOTATION_MARKDoneQUOTATION_MARK now <|endoftext|> Me 2. nice chatting with you. <|endoftext|> Actually, can you do me a huge favor? Can you recommend a good comedy movie? <|endoftext|> sure, how about happy gilmore with adam sandler. <|endoftext|> I like it. I accept that as well. <|endoftext|> ok just recommended happy gilmore. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I'm looking for a really good movie with action, a good plot and excitement/suspense. Do you have any good recomendation for me? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed QUOTATION_MARKThe Quiet Place.QUOTATION_MARK It's about aliens that attack if they hear you. Most of the movie doesn't have a soundtrack, so every noise is suspenseful. <|endoftext|> Interesting. I have never heard of that movie before, but I'm not really into aliens. Could you recommend a movie to me with humans in it? Maybe something along the lines of government plots? <|endoftext|> Have you seen the Jason Bourne movies? A man with amnesia is being chased by government agents. He has to figure out who he is and what they want. <|endoftext|> Yes! I LOVE that movie! That is a great recommendation. But I've already watched the entire series. Do you have any other government movies that you could recommend for me? <|endoftext|> Argo has lots of suspense. Six people from the US Embassy in Iran have to go into hiding after Islamists attack. <|endoftext|> Now that sounds very interesting. I'm going to take that recommendation. Thank you so much for taking the time to offer me such a great suggestion. I very much appreciate it. Please have a great day! <|endoftext|> Have a good one! <|endoftext|> Oh. I'm sorry. That last recommendation was so good, I don't know what to do when I'm finished watching that one LoL! Can you offer me a few more suggestions? <|endoftext|> The Mission Impossible Movies are good if you want something a little more light-hearted. <|endoftext|> That's another great series also. I watched the entire thing. Do you have some more? <|endoftext|> If you don't mind super hero flick, Captain America Winter Soldier has political intrigue. <|endoftext|> I love the dynamic of politics in super hero genres. Good choice. How about something romantic with drama. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen this one but my sister loved QUOTATION_MARKSilver Linings PlaybookQUOTATION_MARK with Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one either, but heard about it. I'm going to accept that recommendation. Thank you for that. Do you have any recommendations about fast supercars? <|endoftext|> Fast and Furious movies! These have action and drama as well. Some funny parts too. <|endoftext|> I thought that you might recommend that :-) Great choice. I've seen them all. How about a good documentary about the industrial revolution? <|endoftext|> I don't watch many documentaries. Would you watch a drama set in that time period? <|endoftext|> Yes I would. What do you suggest? <|endoftext|> Modern Times with Charlie Chaplin. <|endoftext|> Thank you. I am going to check that one out. Thank you so much again for all of the great recommendations. I hope you have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! Interested in seeing a movie?? <|endoftext|> That I am! <|endoftext|> Great! What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like action, comedies, and animated movies. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the trailers for Frozen 2?? <|endoftext|> I have not, but I don't like Frozen. <|endoftext|> Oh! No problem at all. How about The Avengers Endgame? Are you a superhero kind of person? <|endoftext|> Absolutely, I've seen them all! <|endoftext|> I heard Marvel Studios is coming out with a new one called QUOTATION_MARKBlack WidowQUOTATION_MARK in 2020... <|endoftext|> I would LOVE to see that <|endoftext|> Scarlett Johannsen will be in it I think. Looks pretty cool. <|endoftext|> It does, it's right up my alley. She was great in all the other movies. <|endoftext|> Sweet, So would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure! <|endoftext|> hmm, not sure what I'm supposed to do now with this hit... <|endoftext|> I think we just have to hit the 10 conversations haha <|endoftext|> Oh, ok.  Well I have selected the Avengers: Endgame as a recommendation to view the trailer... I really would be interested in that one that comes out in may for sure tho! <|endoftext|> I accept the Avengers: Endgame as the recommendation <|endoftext|> Great! Thanks. <|endoftext|> Thank you for your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, happy thanksgiving! <|endoftext|> Hey, you too. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> I believe Terminator. It's been somewhat of a down year for me. The movie was solid, but nothing special. <|endoftext|> Are you into Science Fiction or more into action? <|endoftext|> I'm open for anything. I'm not picky whatsoever. <|endoftext|> Is there any movie that you've disliked? Any pet peeves? <|endoftext|> I mean, there's been mediocre films, but for the most part, I can find a reason to enjoy a movie, even if for the effort or unique premise. I honestly cannot recall the last film I left theaters being upset seeing. <|endoftext|> You're very open minded! Would you say you appreciate the production value over the acting/script? <|endoftext|> They both play important roles to me. A boring concept with great acting can make a decent film as much as a very unique plot with mediocre acting. Like Godzilla is giant monsters fighting, acting doesn't really matter there, or something like Hateful Eight is a half dozen people sitting in a room and talking for 3 hours, yet it was thrilling. <|endoftext|> I would recommend checking out Raising Arizona if you haven't before! Its a very creative and heart-felt comedy about an ex convict and his wife raising a baby. The plot sounds simple but the script is really good, as is the acting. If you're a fan of Nicholas Cage, this is one of his best performances. <|endoftext|> Oh I've heard of that. Coen Brothers have made several outstanding films. I may have seen this when I was younger, but I legit don't remember. I'll check and see if it's on any streaming. <|endoftext|> Awesome! What other Cohen brother movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Pretty much anything from 2000 on. That's when I started watching them. I haven't seen their Netflix film, Buster Scruggs, but everything else has been a gem. No Country has some of the best cinematography ever. <|endoftext|> The Netflix film is pretty good. Any horror movies you like? <|endoftext|> I don't mind horror, I just don't care for the ghost/paranormal stuff. I like monsters or slashers. The whole Grudge/Ring crazy and now Annabelle/conjuring craze just doesn't interest me. It's all ghosts haunting houses. I like more creative ones like It Follows, or You're Next. Hereditary and Midsommar were both fantastic. <|endoftext|> It Follows was very good. And I loved the themes of motherhood on Hereditary. A24 has been putting out some really high-quality films this year. <|endoftext|> Yea, them and blumhouse tend to put out quality film after quality film. Check out Midsommar if you can, it's 2.5 hours, but fantastic. <|endoftext|> I will! Be sure to check out Raising Arizona. I enjoyed chatting with you a lot! <|endoftext|> Yes, will do. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I love Horror Movies. Also I like Action, Thrillers and Drama. <|endoftext|> What's the last horror movie you saw? <|endoftext|> The last one I saw was Insidious: Last Key. <|endoftext|> Anything stand out for you, in terms of what you liked or disliked about it? <|endoftext|> I liked the fact that the woman is a psychic/medium who went back to her childhood home to get rid of the evil that she released. She found out the secret of many bodies hidden in the house and her dad was a part of it. I disliked how it didn't scare me or make me jump like I would like horror movies to do. <|endoftext|> It still sounds like something I'd enjoy. I like horror a lot too. The scariest movies I've ever seen were Event Horizon, Silent Hill and the original Nightmare on Elm Street. Have you seen any of those? <|endoftext|> I have seen Silent Hill and Nightmare on Elm Street. I don't remember if I have seen Event Horizon. The name of the movie is familiar, but if I have seen it it has been a long time. I do love the serial killer type movies too. My favorite is Michael Myers. He's my favorite. <|endoftext|> I've never seen any of those. But I highly recommend Event Horizon if you haven't seen it. It's about a warp drive engine that opens up a gateway to hell, and has some horrific scenes of demonic entities. <|endoftext|> Oh heck yes. Now I am more interested. Well thank you for that recommendation, I will definitely look into it <|endoftext|> Why don't you check out the trailer and see if you like it? <|endoftext|> That looks like a really interesting movie to watch. The trailer has me interested to find out more on the movie <|endoftext|> Cool -- hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> I will definitely watch it. Thank you. <|endoftext|> You bet! Nice talking to you <|endoftext|> Nice talking to you as well. Take care. <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|> Good bye <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help recommend a movie for you. <|endoftext|> Oh, alright. So, I am thinking about something that maybe is thought-provoking but also has fantasy elements. <|endoftext|> What's one movie you liked that was similar to this? <|endoftext|> Ok, so, I really like MCU and Pixar movies. <|endoftext|> So you like more superhero and/or a decidedly good vs. evil kind of though provoking fantasy? <|endoftext|> Doesn't have to have be good vs. evil, I also enjoy something with an interesting premise but doesn't throw it away in the middle of it. <|endoftext|> Awesome, the movie that first came to mind and now stands out the most has definitely got to be Inception. It's all fantasy and really makes you think about how they're doing what they're doing in the movie. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah that movie is great. <|endoftext|> Christopher Nolan is definitely my favorite director because all of his movies are thriller type movies. Have you ever seen his movie The Prestige? <|endoftext|> Not yet, but I'm intersted. <|endoftext|> I thought it was a great movie. I'm not going to spoil anything for you. It's got so many good actors in it, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, and several more big name actors. <|endoftext|> Alright I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> I can't seem to find a trailer for this movie. Have you ever seen Memento, also directed by Christopher Nolan? <|endoftext|> Huh, really? Well, not that one either, what is it about? <|endoftext|> It's a mystery thriller about a man with amnesia, more or less. The movie is shown in a very unique way where it goes back and forth between present time and flashbacks as the man comes back to remembering these times. My description doesn't make it sound very interesting but I really enjoyed the movie. It was one of Nolan's early movies so it's often overlooked and there aren't any big name actors in it but it is a very interesting premise and I'd recommend it if you like movies that make you think <|endoftext|> Hmm, do you have another Nolan  movie in mind? <|endoftext|> Since you like MCU movies, I'm assuming you've seen The Dark Knight trilogy, but if not I'd really recommend those even if you aren't a DC fan. <|endoftext|> I like those movies. <|endoftext|> The only other Nolan movie I can think of that I've seen that fits what you like would be Interstellar. Have you ever seen it? <|endoftext|> Yeah I've seen it! <|endoftext|> I can't really think of any other Nolan movies that I've seen that you would be interested in. Did my description of Memento make it seem not interesting? <|endoftext|> No, it's I'm not into that. <|endoftext|> Oh, that's okay, I get that. When I said Interstellar, you seemed excited, so the movie it was partially inspired by might be a good movie for you. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a pretty old movie, but it's definitely a classic, it's a sci-fi space movie and is quite a bit similar to Interstellar <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one yet, I heard it's good. <|endoftext|> It's an old movie but it doesn't really seem like it, it seems like it could have been made pretty recently. It won an Oscar and is very generally recommended as a classic movie, and it was directed by Stanley Kubrick. I'd recommend it if you liked Interstellar. <|endoftext|> Alright I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great! It's a pretty good movie that I think you'll enjoy. It's a classic movie that really stands the test of time. <|endoftext|> Alright, thank you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you tonight? <|endoftext|> HI I AM LOOKING FOR NICE MOVIE TO WATCH <|endoftext|> what kinds of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i likw action sci animation comedy . <|endoftext|> what type of action movies more drama, suspense or on your seat action? <|endoftext|> suspence or seat action <|endoftext|> I just watched 47 meters down. It was action packed and suspenfull. <|endoftext|> oh good i lastly watched spiderman home coming <|endoftext|> Have you seen aquaman? Its really good I think you would like it <|endoftext|> ok just say something about aquaman and 47 meters down . <|endoftext|> Aquaman has great actors and is action packed. would you consider this <|endoftext|> yes sure will consider aquaman <|endoftext|> great!

I would like to help you find a good movie to watch next! <|endoftext|> Ok that would be great! <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched that you really enjoyed? <|endoftext|> avengers, endgame <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy all the Marvel movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I do. <|endoftext|> I think you will like a movie called Scott Pilgrim. It has action and super hero type plots. <|endoftext|> I have heard of that but have not seen it, it does sound like a good movie to watch! <|endoftext|> It's also got some very good comedy. There are a lot of actors in it from Marvel movies as well <|endoftext|> Ok cool! I accept your recommendation! Thanks! <|endoftext|> Awesome, I'm excited for you. I think you will really like it <|endoftext|> I think so too! <|endoftext|> The actress who plays Captain Marvel is in it, and so is the actor that plays Captain America <|endoftext|> Oh ok, I did not know that. <|endoftext|> Have you ever heard anything about it? <|endoftext|> Not much, know that micheal Cera plays in it. <|endoftext|> Do you think you would like to watch the movie trailer for it? <|endoftext|> I don <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Hello there, that sounds good. <|endoftext|> What kind of movie trailers are you interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> I like movies that are more serious, mostly rated R. <|endoftext|> What is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> I saw the movie Joker at the movie theater, I thought it was good. <|endoftext|> Would you be interested in a movie with a similar story or something different? <|endoftext|> I liked that it was a bit dark, and I am up for either I would say, but I don't really like the Marvel movies I'll say. <|endoftext|> Whatt about th ie Maledicent: Mistress of Evil. Have you heard of that one? <|endoftext|> No I haven't heard of that one before, what year did it come out? <|endoftext|> The movie Doctor Sleep is also good. Plus, its R-rated <|endoftext|> That sounds good, do you know any of the actors from that one? <|endoftext|> Ewan McGregor, Rebecca Ferguson, Alexandra Essoe, Carl Lumbly, Zahn McClarnon <|endoftext|> That sounds like a solid cast. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch this trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah I'll check it out, sounds like it might be good. <|endoftext|> It is a fantasy/Thriller type movie <|endoftext|> I do like those types of movies so I think I might like it. <|endoftext|> jacob Tremblay and Cliff Curtis also plays in this movie. I am sending the trailer now. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> That sounds good, thank you for your recommendation. <|endoftext|> NO problem <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello this afternoon <|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today <|endoftext|> Great are you looking for a movie recomendation <|endoftext|> I am looking for a moive to take my grandson to today. <|endoftext|> what was the last movie he saw <|endoftext|> The last movie he saw was at my house. He saw boss baby. <|endoftext|> How old is your grandson <|endoftext|> He is 10 years old and likes action movies. <|endoftext|> Some children only like animated movies how about your grandson <|endoftext|> He likes animated movies that have action and are more oriented toward boys. <|endoftext|> How is his attention span, does it need to be a shorter movie <|endoftext|> No he will sit through movies that are two hours long. <|endoftext|> Are you looking for a current in theater movie or one that can be rented and viewed at home? <|endoftext|> I would prefer a theater movie. <|endoftext|> Some boys his age are really into cars especially race cars. How about your grandson <|endoftext|> He likes race cars a lot. <|endoftext|> I would recommend Ford v ferrari <|endoftext|> I have heard about that one. I think he would love it. <|endoftext|> alternatively if a comedy would be of interest QUOTATION_MARKPlaying with FireQUOTATION_MARK is a little more kid oriented <|endoftext|> I will go to Playing with Fire. <|endoftext|> So you would watch the Playing with Fire trailer <|endoftext|> yes we will go to playing with fire <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Great! I'm looking to watch a funny movie <|endoftext|> Perfect. I might know something just for you. What kind of comedies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like most comedies, Adam Sandler is one of my favorite comedians. <|endoftext|> I love Adam Sandler. Do you like Will Ferrell? He is pretty great also! <|endoftext|> I do! Wasn't he in Step Brothers? That movie was hilarious. <|endoftext|> Yes, he was. I loved that one too. I think you would like the movie Longshot based on your humor preferences. <|endoftext|> I've never seen that movie, Who's in it? What's it about? <|endoftext|> It's a super funny romance comedy starring Seth Rogan, who plays as a journalist who gets into a lot of trouble. He runs into one of the smartest women in the world who was his former babysitter and childhood crush. It's pretty awesome. <|endoftext|> That's sounds like a good movie.

What do you like and dislike in horror movies? <|endoftext|> i loved it!! <|endoftext|> Good! I prefer the horror movies that are less QUOTATION_MARKbooQUOTATION_MARK and more suspenseful rather than jumpy. What about you? <|endoftext|> i completely agree!! There are some movies where the acting is just that bad. haha. <|endoftext|> Yes, I can not stand when the acting is bad as well as the graphics. Good graphics are especially important in horror movies. <|endoftext|> I agree. think that also includes the special effects when something looks fake, i think it ruins the entire movie. I love movies that make me jump and just can't look away. I also love horror movies that are based on true life events <|endoftext|> Have you seen Truth or Dare? It seems like a really suspenseful movie that you might like! <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of that. Ill have to check that out tonight. its wednesday take out and movie night.

One of my favorite movie is The Notebook <|endoftext|> The Notebook is a classic! Can't go wrong with Ryan Gosling! <|endoftext|> Right, I love the whole story. I've watched it over and over and my feelings are always the same. I love that fact that he is patient with her from beginning to the end. Persistent! <|endoftext|> I think I've got a good recommendation for you. What's the latest romance movies you've seen? <|endoftext|> Latest, I went and saw Queen and Slim. <|endoftext|> I think you will love A Walk to Remember <|endoftext|> I haven't saw that particular movie but I am now interested. I definitely accept. <|endoftext|> I'll give you some info. follows the rite of passage of a jaded, aimless high school senior (Shane West) who falls in love with a guileless young woman (Mandy Moore) he and his friends once scorned. The two develop a powerful and inspirational relationship in which they discover truths that take most people a lifetime to learn. <|endoftext|> So they were me to her to begin with? <|endoftext|> It is also by Nicholas Sparks, the author of the Notebook so I think you will very much enjoy this. <|endoftext|> Well thanks for the recommendation.

Do you prefer them in that order? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was in theaters called Ford vs Ferrari. <|endoftext|> OMG! I watched that movie too! I loved it... If you like that movie I have a great movie trailer for you... It's action and comedy <|endoftext|> Yes absolutely! It was a great movie! <|endoftext|> I recommend you watch the trailer for Jumanji: the Next Level! It's not out in the theaters yet, but it will be out next week! <|endoftext|> I saw the first one and loved it! I will definitely see it when it comes out! Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> So you like watching movies as soon as they come out or do you wait a week or two? <|endoftext|> It usually depends on how good it looks in the trailer. <|endoftext|> Right? Me too... I try to wait and see the reviews after week one, but some trailers are too good to wait <|endoftext|> I know right! Especially if it is a sequel to a really good movie! <|endoftext|> Do you go to the movies often? <|endoftext|> I try to yes. Do you? <|endoftext|> For sure. It's something I can do with my kids. <|endoftext|> I agree. It is a fun place to go for dates also! <|endoftext|> It was great chatting with you! I like it when I find someone who likes movies as much as I do... <|endoftext|> I agree! Thank you! Take care! <|endoftext|> You Too!:) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hey how's it going? <|endoftext|> Great! How are you? <|endoftext|> Im pretty good! So we are supposed to talk about movies and such. Have you seen any new movies recently? <|endoftext|> I have. I love movies! What is the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Oh goodness, I've been binge watching all the Disney movies lately. I caved and payed for Disney+ I mostly like weird sci fi style movies though. How about you? <|endoftext|> We just got Disney+ too. I can't wait to watch the new Lady and the Tramp, but love that all the Star Wars movies are on there.Will you be watching The Rise of Skywalker when it's released in December? <|endoftext|> Oh man me either!! I cant wait until the live action Lion King is added. I want to watch all the Star Wars movies in sequence with my kiddos. Is that the one that all the Yoda baby memes are from? I haven't seen any trailers for that one yet actually. <|endoftext|> That's amazing! Love passing on the love of Star Wars to our kids. The baby Yoda show is on Disney+ now :) Definitely check out the trailer for the Rise of Skywalker movie...you'll love it! <|endoftext|> Of course, gotta show em what a good movie and story is made up of. I am sooooo far behind! Plus I've been watching Gargoyles a lot too. I will absolutely check that out. So what newer movie have you seen lately? I really want to see the new Adams Family and Kives Out <|endoftext|> That's awesome. The last movie i saw was The Joker with Joaquin Phoenix. It was brilliant. He was brilliant, but it was a sad reflection of society. <|endoftext|> Oh that one looked fantastic too! I think I may have to take a trip to the theaters soon <|endoftext|> Enjoy!! <|endoftext|> I will thank you! I think we need a few more chats before we can submit <|endoftext|> I hope so! <|endoftext|> Its 10 each and my timers getting low <|endoftext|> I hope you like the movies! <|endoftext|> Oh Im sure I will thank you for the recommendations <|endoftext|> Great chatting with you! <|endoftext|> You too! Have an awesome night and holiday! <|endoftext|> Thanks! You too! I'm in Canada...we had our Thanksgiving earlier in October :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, How are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm good! How are you? <|endoftext|> Good, thank you for asking.:) <|endoftext|> So, I'm looking for a movie recommendation. Do you know any good psychological thrillers? Maybe something with a female lead? <|endoftext|> One of my favorites in Hannibal. Have you seen the movie or read the book? Jodi Foster is amazing in it. <|endoftext|> I've read the book but never saw that movie! I think I will try Hannibal. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> I believe they did a second book and or movie as well. One you see the movie you should look to see if there is a second one. <|endoftext|> Awesome! I will check. Thank you. <|endoftext|> Once you watch Hannibal, let me know your thoughts. If it is good as the book. <|endoftext|> Will do! Talk to you later. <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I usually like to see the trailer first. <|endoftext|> I am trying to send the trailer but am not quite sure how to do it.:( <|endoftext|> That's ok, I can search for it. <|endoftext|> Great, I believe there is one with Julianne Moore as well. <|endoftext|> That's cool. I like her as well. <|endoftext|> I was wrong, it is Silence of the Lambs with Jodi Foster! <|endoftext|> Oh, ok! So there's a few movies. I've read all the books so I better finally watch the movies. <|endoftext|> I agree. You should plan a movie night and watch them all in a row. <|endoftext|> Sounds good! I think I'll do that this weekend. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you choose a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Cool! I love movies <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like best? <|endoftext|> I like horror movies usually <|endoftext|> Ooooh, scary! What was the most recent horror movie you've seen, and what did you like about it? <|endoftext|> I really liked 1917 because I'm a huge King fan and a history nerd, but I don't usually like historical movies <|endoftext|> When it comes to scary movies, is it QUOTATION_MARKthe scarier the betterQUOTATION_MARK for you? <|endoftext|> Heck yes, I don't often find movies that actually freak me out :) <|endoftext|> Do you typically prefer newer horror movies or the classics? <|endoftext|> Usually, yes <|endoftext|> OK, have a movie trailer to suggest: Pet Sematary, based on the book of the same name. I recommend this movie because I've seen it and it's really scary. Would you like to watch this move trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes that sounds perfect! <|endoftext|> Enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|> I hope it's scary enough for you, it was plenty scary for me (but that's why I'm not too big of a horror movie fan) <|endoftext|> It might be, I hope it compares well to the original one! <|endoftext|> Think don't make 'em like they used to (in terms of horror movies and many other things) <|endoftext|> They certainly don't, seems like almost everything is a remake of something else these days. <|endoftext|> I hope this one is up to your standards, and keeps you up tonight! <|endoftext|> Me too! Gonna get my popcorn ready :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> hay whats up <|endoftext|> How are you, are you passionate about movies? <|endoftext|> oh yeah, most definitely <|endoftext|> What genre of movies is your favorite? <|endoftext|> Animation, comedies, and Action adventures <|endoftext|> And which comedy movie is your favorite? <|endoftext|> i honestly cant think of one I like above others. Kung fu hustle is a good one that comes to mind <|endoftext|> What did you like most about that movie? I liked the comedy movie about son like children, the very funny alle <|endoftext|> I have never herd of that one <|endoftext|> Do you know kung fu? <|endoftext|> no, but i did take kick boxing <|endoftext|> Is it action? <|endoftext|> I suppose <|endoftext|> What do you like most about that movie? <|endoftext|> kung fu hustle? Its a parody on kung fu movies while being entertaining all on its own <|endoftext|> The kung fu panda animated movie <|endoftext|> that is good too <|endoftext|> Have you seen the 3? <|endoftext|> i have not <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I hear you're looking for a film to watch! <|endoftext|> hi yes i am <|endoftext|> Awesome! What's your favorite movie? <|endoftext|> inglorious bastards <|endoftext|> Oh, that's a fantastic movie! Tarantino is a genius. Have you seen his latest film, QUOTATION_MARKOnce Upon a Time in HollywoodQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> yes i did <|endoftext|> Did you like it? Are you a fan of Oscar-nominated films? <|endoftext|> yes i am <|endoftext|> I think they're pretty great too, most of the time. I have a friend who really likes Inglourious Basterds and also really likes Black Book. Have you heard of it? <|endoftext|> i do not <|endoftext|> Black Book is a 2006 Dutch war film with a very similar tone to Tarantino's films. It's witty, insightful, violent, and sexy. Are you interested in watching the trailer? <|endoftext|> yes i am <|endoftext|> Huh, it looks like our database doesn't have international films listed. Another film I recommend is True Romance, starring Brad Pitt. Again, very similar vibe. I can get that trailer for you if you like. <|endoftext|> i accept <|endoftext|> Excellent, I can send it along in a second. I think you'll like it -- it's got the over-the-top violence of a Tarantino film with the thrill of a 90s action film. <|endoftext|> that is good <|endoftext|> I hope you like it. It's a good film for a Friday night Netflix-and-chill. <|endoftext|> i really like netflix and chill <|endoftext|> Haha, I do too. Sending that trailer now. <|endoftext|> i accept <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I'm good! Im looking for movie recommendations <|endoftext|> Nice! And good, I am here to help you with that. Any genre you are interested in? <|endoftext|> I'm thinkingm action <|endoftext|> Sounds good, do you like older movies (pre-2000's) or more recent ones? <|endoftext|> more recent ones. <|endoftext|> Sounds good, and do you like PG-PG-13 or more adult movies? <|endoftext|> More adult movies. <|endoftext|> Okay then, and do you like blood and gore or do you want more drama type? <|endoftext|> Blood and gore all the way. <|endoftext|> I think I have found a good one you might enjoy. <|endoftext|> What would you recommend? <|endoftext|> It's called, Mad Max: Fury Road. Have you heard of it before? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> Yes I have, I thought it was really good. It had lots of action! <|endoftext|> Was it blood and gore? <|endoftext|> Oh yes, it has plenty of that in it for sure. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Thanks! <|endoftext|> You are welcome, I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will! Any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> I think you would also like the movie, Logan. <|endoftext|> Whats that about? <|endoftext|> It was about one of the members of the X-men, it had lots of blood! But I hope you like the Mad Max one. <|endoftext|> Awesome! I accept. Thanks for your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How's it going? <|endoftext|> Good how are you? <|endoftext|> Great. What are you up to today? <|endoftext|> Not much just watching some television. I am looking for a movie to watch <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like scary movies. <|endoftext|> Do you like movies with monster or aliens, or just a human murdering everyone in sight lol <|endoftext|> Hahaha I like the human murdering everyone in sight ones. Those are scary because they could be real! <|endoftext|> I know. I hear Doctor Sleep is pretty good. <|endoftext|> What is it about? <|endoftext|> Its sort of a sequel to the shining. <|endoftext|> Oh  I liked the shining. Who is acting in it? <|endoftext|> Ewan McGregor. He is so handsome <|endoftext|> I agree. I accept your recommendation I am going to watch that! <|endoftext|> I don't think you'll be disappointed <|endoftext|> Who else is in it? <|endoftext|> Rebecca Ferguson and Jacob Tremblay <|endoftext|> Oh I've never seen them in anything but Ewan MacGregor is good <|endoftext|> He's been in a lot of great films <|endoftext|> I liked him in Star Wars and Moulin Rouge <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> I would like to help you find a good movie, what type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> im looking for a great horror movie something in the paranormal subject <|endoftext|> what was the last horror movie you watched? <|endoftext|> a movie called it chapter 2 <|endoftext|> good choice! what was your favorite part about that movie? <|endoftext|> i liked that it had a sort of a voodoo type idea that was linked to pennywise <|endoftext|> is there anything that you really didn't care for in that movie? <|endoftext|> i didnt like that all it took to kill pennywise was to make him small and feel like he wasnt real sort of like other movies <|endoftext|> I would personally recommend The Witch. It about a colonial american family who is afraid the daughter is involved with witchcraft. <|endoftext|> alright that sounds like a good movie im gonna check it out thank you <|endoftext|> No problem! The trailer for the movie should be coming your way. I hope you enjoy watching it <|endoftext|> alright thanks <|endoftext|> hopefully you'll really like it and be able to find some more great horror movies like it <|endoftext|> i think i will and yes there should be some good ones coming out soon <|endoftext|> for sure! I have heard there is some new ones coming out in the next year <|endoftext|> i wanna see the new grudge <|endoftext|> It looks interesting especially since they have Lin Shaye as one of the lead actors <|endoftext|> ya he is a great actor glad they decided to reboot it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> Better than some, worse than others. Thanks for asking! <|endoftext|> You are most welcome. lol :) Do you like movies and if so which genre? <|endoftext|> I love movies. Science fiction is probably my favorite, followed by action/drama or action/thriller. <|endoftext|> which film have you seen recently? i love that genre also <|endoftext|> It's probably not the last science fiction film I've seen, but the one that comes to mind first is Blade Runner 2049. <|endoftext|> I love Blade Runner. Especially more older films <|endoftext|> Despite it's faults, I really enjoy the original Blade Runner. It has a fantastic atmosphere. Yeah, they don't make movies like they used to. <|endoftext|> If they had Keanu Reeves it would have been better. The ain actor ruined the film. Speaking of Keanu I loved Replicas. <|endoftext|> Yeah, Keanu Reeves is great! What is Replicas? I don't think I know that one. <|endoftext|> He is the main role it is similar to x-files and a mix of matrix. Cloning. i really like it and i think you would. you should check it out. <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting. Is it a newer film? <|endoftext|> 2018 byt anything this guy makes is really good. he is under rated in my opinion. he would have been awesome in the newer version of the shining rather than ewan mcgregor. <|endoftext|> Never been a fan of Ewan McGregor to be honest. Cool, so pretty recent, surprised I never heard of it. Any other actors of note in Replicas? <|endoftext|> me neither. a bunch of unknowns which makes it better and he tends to make those types of films anyhow. But John Ortiz has made some films for drama <|endoftext|> Replicas sounds great, I feel like Keanu Reeves has been everywhere recently, but I only recall seeing the him in John Wick films as of late. I'd love to see the trailer for it and check it out. <|endoftext|> awesome. no one would ever play john wick better than him btw. i wish they had him in deathwish rather than the other guy from die hard <|endoftext|> Ha, I never watched the new Deathwish. I've seen some of the originals and even those were done to death by Charles Bronson. Would be great to see Hollywood embrace more original ideas instead of drudging up established IP's because of their noteriety. <|endoftext|> i agree. everything is a remake. they are even trying to remake now Hitchcock's films. which we both know will ruin the films. <|endoftext|> I recently found out they already redid Psycho a few years back, I was shocked. <|endoftext|> yea that was not the same. back then they had great actors that didnt need technology to pull you into the film. have you seen the purge? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen any of the Purge films. Going to check out Replicas though, thanks for the recommendation. Take care! <|endoftext|> you are welcome and i highly recommend the most of his is knock knock watch that first <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like movies that involve romance and drama. I also like movies that involve action and comedy. <|endoftext|> What's the last movie in each of those types that you've watched? <|endoftext|> Recently, I have watched twilight. I also watched Step Brothers, The Grinch, and The Hangover. <|endoftext|> So it seems that you've been into comedies recently, would you like to see a trailer for another one or something a little different? <|endoftext|> Something a little different. <|endoftext|> Something a little more in the romance/drama realm? <|endoftext|> That Sounds Great! <|endoftext|> I think you'd really like A Star is Born. Came out to great reviews from audiences and critics alike, and, its got great music with the drama/romantics that you are looking for! <|endoftext|> What is the movie about? <|endoftext|> It stars Bradley Cooper, an old musician, who helps a younger musician, Lady Gaga, rise to stardom while his age and struggles with alcohol sees his career take a turn for the worse. <|endoftext|> When was it released? <|endoftext|> Came out just last year, in October of 2018 <|endoftext|> What is the movie rated? <|endoftext|> Its rated R for language throughout, some sexuality/nudity and substance abuse <|endoftext|> Are there any other big stars besides Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper in the movie? <|endoftext|> It also has Sam Elliot, Andrew Dice Clay, Dave Chapelle, and Anthony Ramos <|endoftext|> This movie sounds great! I think I will definitely give it a try! Do you have any other good movie recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> I'd also recommend Love Simon, its more of a teen romance/drama, but it was still pretty good! <|endoftext|> Thanks! I have seen that movie and I loved it! I accept your recommendation for A Star is Born. <|endoftext|> Glad to hear it! I hope you enjoy. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> What kinds of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> horror but not jump scare horror. some of my favorites are... The Witch, Hereditary, Midsummer, The shining <|endoftext|> Whats the latest movie you've seen in theaters? <|endoftext|> Midsommer by A24.

The way the movie was shot was just art, highly recommend <|endoftext|> Nice, I haven't heard of it, I'll have to look into that. So, since you liked the shining, have heard about the prequel? <|endoftext|> I have actually, QUOTATION_MARKdoctor sleepQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Yes, do you plan to see it? <|endoftext|> I am interested in seeing it yes <|endoftext|> Cool, would you like to see a trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would like to see the trailer <|endoftext|> Nice, i sent it over. Are you a fan of Ewan McGregor in general? <|endoftext|> Yes I am. I accept that recommendation <|endoftext|> We have to keep talking a bit longer, but we're almost there. What are your expectations of the movie, do you think it'll live up to The Shining? <|endoftext|> I don't think it will but I'd hope so <|endoftext|> I don't think so either, but fingers crossed. I just realized it was a sequel and not a prequel, i don't know why I thought it was the other way around <|endoftext|> haha yes he is all grown up in this one. Great recommendation, cannot wait to see it <|endoftext|> Cool, well, i guess we're good. Have a great day <|endoftext|> you as well thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello!

My daughter was into the original frozen, but has NO interest in Frozen 2..she's WAY too cool for it, lol. <|endoftext|> nope my kids are now older but it was enjoyable <|endoftext|> I may have to watch it..I'll probably end up watching it eventually, no way to avoid all these disney movies, lol <|endoftext|> exactly! Do you enjoy going to the movies and seeing new releases or on TV (a home) <|endoftext|> I usually watch releases at home, but I do like to go to the fancy Dolby Theater for big releases, like Avengers. <|endoftext|> Nice. comfort is always the best especially for an action movie <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree! The new theaters have relciners and a good amount of space between people, that's pretty important. <|endoftext|> Are you going to see the new starwars movie. <|endoftext|> Oh, I wasn't even thinking about that one, but I should. I need to get caught up with the last 2! <|endoftext|> yes you should if you like action. we already have tickets for december <|endoftext|> That's it. That's the winner.

Any suggestions? <|endoftext|> Well there are lots of amazing movies out there. What are some recent movies that you've really liked? <|endoftext|> It has been a while since I watched one but I like comedies and some action movies. <|endoftext|> Me too. Do you like really intense action? <|endoftext|> I like action based on true stories. Any come to mind? <|endoftext|> American Sniper is great based on a true story.

If not I can use that to pick something else for you. <|endoftext|> That looks like something I would like. Is there a favorite for you? <|endoftext|> As far as action movies I like things with some comedy in them as well. The Rush Hour series is a good one for me. It's not a real life based movie. <|endoftext|> Good idea! I like Rush Hour. <|endoftext|> Jackie Chan always makes me have a good night watching movies. Think you'll be giving one of these a watch tonight? I might just put on Rush Hour. <|endoftext|> I think I will put Rush Hour on. That is a good movie and I already know I like it. <|endoftext|> Great choice. <|endoftext|> Thanks for the suggestion. Enjoy your movie watching. <|endoftext|> You enjoy as well.

I am going to try and recommend a movie trailer for you to check.What do you think? <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> What types of movies are you into? <|endoftext|> I like thoughtful quirky movies. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched Frozen with my neice <|endoftext|> That was an excellent kids film, I recently watched it for the 100th time with my daughter. Do you want a movie with a similar story to Frozen or a completely different one? <|endoftext|> I would love something similar. <|endoftext|> I was really impressed with the second Frozen that recently came out on Blu-Ray. My daughter loved it in the theaters and I thought it was an excellent sequel. <|endoftext|> Yes, I gave my niece a frozen 2 book. I could watch that. <|endoftext|> Awesome, I think you will enjoy that film. Seeing Elsa save the Kingdom is a must! So you do want to check the trailer out? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would like that. <|endoftext|> What did you think of the first Frozen? <|endoftext|> I thought it was great. <|endoftext|> Who was your favorite character in that one? Mine was Olaf. <|endoftext|> I liked Elsa because that was my neice's recommendation. <|endoftext|> Elsa is a good one. In the second film she plays a great lead. You will enjoy her, I promise! <|endoftext|> I will see it then <|endoftext|> Sounds good, if you need any more recommendations I can always help! <|endoftext|> that should do it. thanks <|endoftext|> Anytime, you are welcome! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you my name is Alex <|endoftext|> Hey Alex, any movie recommendations? <|endoftext|> I like to watch older movies. any monty python movies or lethal weapon movies are great <|endoftext|> Love Lethal Weapon flicks! Only saw Monty Python and Holy Grail but loved it! <|endoftext|> They are classics. I saw naked gun for the first time in a while the other night. Also saw Scarface for the first time last week. What movies have you seen recently? <|endoftext|> Both excellent flicks but vastly different haha! I love older flicks as well. Saw three Oclock High and Doctor Sleep! Both solid flicks! <|endoftext|> I have never seen those ones, I got to check them out. What do you like about those movies? <|endoftext|> One is classic 80s comedy,  the other was a solid sequel to the Shining! Very well made and I am a sucker for Horror! Well <|endoftext|> Gotchu, I gotta check those out but I should watch The Shining first. I surprisingly have never seen it although I always hear about it. I love horror as well. Have you seen Amityville horror? <|endoftext|> Not in a long time!!! I would like to watch that! Not sure how to do it but I accept that recommendation haha!! <|endoftext|> Haha sounds good. I see you like older movies and you have seen alot of the classics ive mentioned. I am going to watch some trailers on the two movies tyouve said youve seen recently. How often you watc movies? <|endoftext|> Sadly almost every night! Ive seen alot of garbage haha  I enjoy watching B movies because they are funny because they are so bad. Watch Bad Ben on Amazon for a chuckle! Found footage horror but so cheap and bad! Hysterical <|endoftext|> I enjoy movies but cant watch them too often because I have short attention span haha. I like classics because I feel like the newer movies arent as well made and there are alot of remakes out. What are your favorite classics? <|endoftext|> Rear Window is my favorite! Classic Hitchcock. Most brilliant film I have ever seen. It was the first time I saw subtext painted by camerawork and could see the story he was painting underneath the main story. Amazing. <|endoftext|> You have me convinced on that one I gotta check it out. You have most likely seen Adam Sandler classics. Have you seen Little Nicky? <|endoftext|> Yes, and I will never see that one again haha! I am going to reject that one haha and accept Amittyville Horror <|endoftext|> Sounds good! <|endoftext|> One more thing! You should Check out Psycho if you can! Nearly as brilliant as Rear Window and super influential on horror! <|endoftext|> For sure id love too <|endoftext|> BTW, I enjoyed the back and forth! Hope you get the bonus! Also, what is your favorite flick of all time? <|endoftext|> Same to you my all time fav would have to be Happy Gilmore. I can watch it a million times and still crack up. Nice talking to you too <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you find a good movie trailer to watch! <|endoftext|> I really like comedy and horror movies! <|endoftext|> Awesome! Thanks for the tip. Do you have a favorite actor? <|endoftext|> I like seth Rogan <|endoftext|> Good to know. Thanks! <|endoftext|> I also perfer R rated movies <|endoftext|> I'm not to big on horror, but there are a few that I don't mind watching. R rated comedies are one of my favorite types of movies too. I think I have a sense of what you'd enjoy watching <|endoftext|> Ok that is good I also like seth mcfarland <|endoftext|> I think we have similar tastes in comedians. What movies have you seen recently that stood out to you? <|endoftext|> Its not a new movie but I saw Ted and really liked it <|endoftext|> Ted was pretty funny. I haven't watched it in a while, but I remember liking it when it came out. Interesting concept for a movie. Do you like the movie superbad? <|endoftext|> I have never heard of it! I might <|endoftext|> I think you would. Seth Rogan has a small part in it, but it's really funny overall. Great cast of talented comedians. Lots of laugh out loud moments. <|endoftext|> What is the plot? <|endoftext|> Two co-dependent high school seniors are forced to deal with separation anxiety after their plan to stage a booze-soaked party goes awry. <|endoftext|> That does sound cool! What is it rated? <|endoftext|> I believe it is rated R, if that's what you were asking. Apparently Rotten tomatoes gave it an 87% so a good amount of people enjoyed the movie. <|endoftext|> That does sound good! Would you happen to know if it includes nudity? <|endoftext|> I don't remember any actual nudity. I remember maybe the movie briefly showing or referring to pornographic magazines and websites. Also there were drawings of private parts but that's all. Is that a problem? <|endoftext|> Ok that sounds good then can you recommend it? <|endoftext|> Most definitely. Would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you? <|endoftext|> look for an action movie to see <|endoftext|> Is there any favorite action movies you have seen in the past? <|endoftext|> fast and furious and john wick <|endoftext|> OK thanks that helps me find a movie for you. <|endoftext|> I like newer movie that just came out <|endoftext|> what about 21 Bridges that just opened a week ago. <|endoftext|> any movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger <|endoftext|> Sure what about Terminator: Dark Fate <|endoftext|> did that one come out this year? <|endoftext|> Yes Nov 2019 <|endoftext|> yes thank you <|endoftext|> So you agree to see  Terminator: Dark Fate <|endoftext|> yes thank you <|endoftext|> Great is there any other you want to see <|endoftext|> no, I like terminator and want to see the new one <|endoftext|> great I hope you will enjoy and let me know if you do not like it. <|endoftext|> i definately would <|endoftext|> fantastic.

Can you recommend a movie for me to watch? <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen My Sister's Keeper? It's a very good movie but it is a bit sad. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it. Do you have anything that you can recommend that isn't sad? <|endoftext|> Another great movie i would recommend is The Great Gatsby. It's a very fun movie to watch. <|endoftext|> Now that does sound fun! What do you like about it? <|endoftext|> I like that is about partying and love. It's is set in the 1920's and it has 2 very well known actors as main roles, Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire. <|endoftext|> Love those guys! That does sound like fun. I'm sold! I accept your movie recommendation. I will watch it tonight! <|endoftext|> It has also won 2 Oscars <|endoftext|> Do you know what the Oscars were for? <|endoftext|> best production design and best costume design <|endoftext|> That makes sense -- if it's set in the 1920s there would have been a lot of need for that. Would you call it a comedy or a drama? <|endoftext|> Drama but there are funny parts through out as well <|endoftext|> That's cool. As long as it won't bum me out. And like I said I like DiCaprio and Maguire. Who's the leading woman? <|endoftext|> Carey Mulligan is who plays the leading female role <|endoftext|> Hmm I'll have to look her up. When was it made? Seems like it must be fairly new, right? <|endoftext|> The movie was made in 2013 <|endoftext|> Nice. Well, I won't be home from work until ten tonight, but I'm definitely going to watch the movie then. Like I said before, I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi , I am here to help you find a movie trailer <|endoftext|> I would love to see a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies are your favorites? <|endoftext|> Right now I would prefer a dark comedy. <|endoftext|> Any actors that you like a lot ? <|endoftext|> It's not incredibly important to me but Christopher Walken, Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Kevin Kline, Christoph Waltz, Gary Oldman, Robert DeNiro. <|endoftext|> Name an example of a dark comedy that you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I love Clay Pigeons, This is the End, War of the Roses, Fright Night. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I just rewatched Once Upon a Time In Hollywood. <|endoftext|> Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|> Very much. I love Tarantino and many of his influences. <|endoftext|> I am a fan of Tarantino also, can I recommend a trailer of one of his movies? <|endoftext|> What would you recommend? <|endoftext|> Four rooms is a little known movie of his that is also a dark comedy <|endoftext|> I have actually seen that one more recently. Do you maybe have one from the last ten years? Even if I've seen it it may have been a while and in need of a rewatch. <|endoftext|> How about The Hateful Eight? <|endoftext|> That one has been a while for me. I would love to see the trailer to remind me of things I may have forgot. <|endoftext|> Great , I liked it and should see it again also. <|endoftext|> I think it's definitely worth a rewatch, especially now that I know how it turns out and I can watch for hints. Thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you doing? Would you like to pick a movie for Friday evening? <|endoftext|> Sure, do you like Tom Cruise? He has a new movie coming out that is a sequel to Top Gun. <|endoftext|> Yes Tom Cruise is a terrific actor. I am not entirely sure about the release date for Top Gun 2 but it sounds exciting. Is that the movie you are interested in? <|endoftext|> Yes, that is the movie I am interested in. I like action and flying, so I think it could be fun. Should we watch the trailer for Top Gun Maverick? The movie itself doesn't come out until summer. <|endoftext|> Yes sounds like a good idea. Especially when you are a big fan of Tom Cruise <|endoftext|> You seem to be a fan as well, which of the Mission Impossible movies is your favorite? <|endoftext|> I like 4-6. I liked the first three too but they don't compare to the last three ones. What about you? <|endoftext|> Same, the newer ones are way more rewatchable and have great stunts too. 1-3 are a bit dated. Well let's watch the Top Gun Maverick trailer and try to figure out how they did these stunts! What do you say? <|endoftext|> Sounds great! Let me know if you liked the trailer <|endoftext|> It looks so exciting. I think Tom Cruise is a licensed pilot and you can really tell he knows what he's doing up there. <|endoftext|> Yeah he does most of movie stunts himself doesn't he? He is very committed to acting <|endoftext|> Yeah, did you see in MI: Fallout he broke his ankle and kept going? That is dedication! <|endoftext|> Yeah and the motor cycle chase in all his MI movies. (I am sorry I forgot to click the trailer) <|endoftext|> Yeah, he rides a motorcyle in the trailer for Maverick as well. I have never ridden on one, have you? I prefer a roof and doors, myself. <|endoftext|> Yes me neither. I don't feel safe on a motorcycle. Hope you enjoy Top Gun tonight! <|endoftext|> Maybe I'll make it a double feature, anything else you can recommend? <|endoftext|> You know the new Mummy movie was kinda fun. It wasn't great though. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> No I didn't see that, I will add that to the queue. They have made so many mummy movies though I can't even keep track. <|endoftext|> Well. To be honest, it is a fun movie. You might like it <|endoftext|> Wonderful, thanks for the recommendation. Now I've got two good movies to watch tonight, thanks!

Now he looks like the actual character! <|endoftext|> Well thats good, haha! I think they will love it. I need a movie for my husband and I to go see, with no kids. Any good recommendations? <|endoftext|> Really depends, are you looking for a date movie, or maybe more of just a night-on-the-town movie? <|endoftext|> Well my husband isn't a fan of any sappy movies. He likes action/suspense movies. So maybe something along the lines would be great? <|endoftext|> 1917 would be perfect then! It is one of the best suspenseful movies I've seen so far. <|endoftext|> I havent heard of this one, what is it about? <|endoftext|> It's about British Soldiers attempting to deliver a message about a German Attack in World War I. Very suspenseful, as you can probably tell. <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting!! I am not much of a fan of war movies! I still would like to see something my husband would like as well as me, any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Do you like comedies? Jumanji 2 has a lot of comedy, and action! As well as A list actors! <|endoftext|> We both like comedies as well!! We loved the first Jumanji! I think this one would be a great one to see!! Thanks!! <|endoftext|> No problem! I hope you like it if you see it! <|endoftext|> Yes!! We didnt get to go out for Valentine's Day, so we are due for a datenight! This will be perfect! <|endoftext|> Aww, that's sweet. I hope you two have a nice time. <|endoftext|> Thanks again, we accept your recommendation, and will have a great time! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there <|endoftext|> Hello. Do you have a recommendation? <|endoftext|> What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I enjoy comedies and thrillers. <|endoftext|> Oh nice! I've always loved Nightmare on Elm Street as a thriller <|endoftext|> I have never seen that actually. I am a HUGE Stephen King fan! <|endoftext|> Nice! Have you ever seen It? <|endoftext|> I have not. It has been on my QUOTATION_MARKtoo watchQUOTATION_MARK list for awhile. I really like campy movies that are super predictable. Those 80's slasher, horror type films. <|endoftext|> Gotcha, I'd definitely recommend it! <|endoftext|> I will take you up on that recommendation! <|endoftext|> You may enjoy The Shining <|endoftext|> I LOVE THAT MOVIE! <|endoftext|> Awesome! Both that and Psycho are classics <|endoftext|> Psycho is fantastic! Have you ever seen Rear Window? <|endoftext|> I actually haven't! What's it about? <|endoftext|> Its about a man who is injured and in a wheelchair and all he can do is watch the couryard in his apartment complex all day. He hears gunshots and sees someone commit a murder <|endoftext|> Ah, that sounds so interesting. It reminds me a bit of the Stanford Prison Experiment movie - also highly recommended <|endoftext|> Oh I will have to take you up on that recommendation as well! <|endoftext|> Awesome, glad I could help! <|endoftext|> No problem! Looks like we might have to take a few more speaking turns in order to click. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> I'm thinking about going to the movies this weekend. What are your movie preferences? <|endoftext|> I like comedy or adventure action movies <|endoftext|> Same here. I have a friend in LA who directs horror/comedies. What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I just recently watched the last Rambo movie <|endoftext|> Cool. What did you like about it and would you want the next movie you see to have a similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> It was typical Stallone with him fighting the drug lords for his daughter. Yes I like movies similar to that. <|endoftext|> If you like action, you'd probably like the new Resident Evil re-boot. Would you like to watch it's trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the previous ones? <|endoftext|> Not yet. Have you? <|endoftext|> Yeah. A lot of them run the same storyline, but the Final Chapter one summarizes them up pretty well and puts a nice bow on the plot. <|endoftext|> Ok. Thank you I will check it out. What are you going to see this weekend <|endoftext|> I have a 13 year old so I can imagine something like Sonic. There isn't much out now. <|endoftext|> It is the off season. My girlfriend has a 5 year old who loves Disney movies <|endoftext|> That's cool. I bet Disney + comes in handy. <|endoftext|> Yes. All the latest Disney movies she has to see. The trailers make it hard to say no <|endoftext|> Awesome. Check out Ready or Not if you like horror and comedy movies. That's my friend's newest movie. <|endoftext|> Cool I will check it out <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, nice to meet you. <|endoftext|> Hi, nice to meet you as well. <|endoftext|> Are you enjoying your day? <|endoftext|> Yes. I hope you are as well. <|endoftext|> I am, I just got done watching a really good movie. Do you like to watch movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do. Do you have a recommendation? <|endoftext|> I do. What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Little Women <|endoftext|> Nice, I heard that was very good. What did you think of it? <|endoftext|> I thought it was very well done. The actors, the story... It was a very enjoyable experience. <|endoftext|> I would recommend Lady Bird. The acting is great and it has an interesting story line. <|endoftext|> I've been wanting to see that. I accept the recommendation.:) <|endoftext|> Great!! I hope you enjoy. I have to go now, it was nice to meet you. <|endoftext|> Thank you. Can you tell me what your favorite part of the movie was before you go? <|endoftext|> I love the scene in the coffee shop, I would tell you more but you would have to see it for yourself. <|endoftext|> I will be on the look out for that scene. Do you prefer to see movies in the theater or at home? <|endoftext|> In theaters <|endoftext|> Same for me. What do you like about the theater? <|endoftext|> The atmosphere and the popcorn <|endoftext|> Popcorn and a coke is my favorite! Thank you again for your recommendation. I hope you have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello partner, I'm here to help you choose a movie! <|endoftext|> Thank you! I love comedy movies <|endoftext|> That's great, so do I! What was the last comedy movie you saw? <|endoftext|> I saw Little <|endoftext|> Amazing! I love Marsai Martin in it! What did you think of the movie? <|endoftext|> I enjoyed it, I was laughing the whole time! The plot was really good <|endoftext|> Great! Do you have any favorite comedy actors, or do you think the plot is the most important part? <|endoftext|> THe plot is most important to me! I love to laugh but I also like a good story as well <|endoftext|> I agree! Do you think you'd be interested in other age-swap plots? <|endoftext|> Yes I would be! <|endoftext|> I think 13 Going on 30 would be a perfect match. I'd easily consider it a classic, and Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo do an amazing job in it! <|endoftext|> Great! I will watch it! I've heard that it is a good movie <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you enjoy it! I think it's one everyone should see at least once. <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|> Not a problem! <|endoftext|> I just looked up the plot! I'm excited to watch it <|endoftext|> It's an older movie, coming out in 2004, but an age-swap story is truly timeless! <|endoftext|> I agree! Freaky friday is also a good one with Lindsay Lohan <|endoftext|> Yes! Even the original is good! Well I hope you enjoy the movie! Please let me know if you need any other recommendations. <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Greetings fellow movie buff <|endoftext|> Good Morning friend. <|endoftext|> Did you have an opportunity to catch any films this past weekend <|endoftext|> I have not, what's a good one that'd you'd suggest for a fellow to watch? One that could really grip your attention without leaving to many plot holes with a all-around good setting, script, cast and directing? <|endoftext|> I am holding out til later this week to catch the new Clint Eastwood movie Jewell <|endoftext|> Tell me about it? What's the plot to the movie? Do you think it'll be a good movie, even if the media isn't covering it hardcore like the upcoming Star Wars or past Avengers? <|endoftext|> It revolves around the Atlanta olympics bombing suspect Richard Jewell . <|endoftext|> I'll have to look into this movie then, sounds like a plausible winner. <|endoftext|> I am not too in to the Star Wars  or  superhero movies. I prefer realistic stories <|endoftext|> They've never been my taste either, but the media covers them like no tomorrow. Whilst leaving moving deserving of coverage marooned. <|endoftext|> Got it <|endoftext|> So a movie like 'American Sniper' would be more your glass of wine then? <|endoftext|> Got it <|endoftext|> What about the Benghazi movie, I believe is how it's spelt. <|endoftext|> Close enough...that one I have not seen however will bump it up on my list <|endoftext|> It's definitely worth a watch. I didn't think I'd like it as much as I did. Thanks for the recommendation though, I'll definitely try and catch Jewell for my next movie. <|endoftext|> My pleasure, I am looking up the Bengahzi movie now <|endoftext|> It's about recent events in the Middle East when they attacked our Embassy. It's inspired on true life events. <|endoftext|> Was that with John Kranaski from the office TV Show? <|endoftext|> Yes, it is! He does a pretty great job in this. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, my name is Jackie. How are you today? <|endoftext|> Hello!

Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Anytime, I hope you enjoy it. It kept me on the edge of my seat. <|endoftext|> What is your favorite movie that I could also watch? <|endoftext|> My favorite movie of all time is Its a Wonderful Life, but I like all kinds of movies.

I here you may be looking for a movie trailer to watch? I am a big movie buff! <|endoftext|> Oh yes me to. Have you seen Dr Sleep? <|endoftext|> I have not yet. It is definitely on my must see soon radar. Have you watched it? <|endoftext|> Yes it is awesome! Do you have any suggestions for another movie? <|endoftext|> Is that your favorite genre? Would you like something similar? <|endoftext|> I like thrillers mostly, or adventure. <|endoftext|> What is your favorite movie of all time? <|endoftext|> I love all the Star Wars movies. Especially the older ones from the 70's 80's <|endoftext|> Nice! Those are definitely some classics! Have you seen the newest? The Rise of Skywalker? <|endoftext|> I plan on seeing that when it comes out. I wasn't crazy about the last one so I'm hoping this one will be good. <|endoftext|> It comes out in 15 days! I'm pumped and plan on watching it over the holidays. J.J. Abrams is great and I think this will live up to expectations. <|endoftext|> Oh yes J.J. is directing this one and am hoping for a good completion to the saga. Do you recommend I should plan on seeing it then? <|endoftext|> Is this one you would be interested in? <|endoftext|> Yes it definitely is. <|endoftext|> I definitely recommend it! Would you like to plan on watching the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes absolutely! <|endoftext|> Great! Enjoy the trailer and have a good evening! <|endoftext|> Thank you and you too. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Greetings, I understand you are looking for movie recommendations. <|endoftext|> Yes, I am. What do you recommend? <|endoftext|> What types of movies are you interested in? <|endoftext|> Good question. Some days I like sci-fi & fantasy, others I like drama. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw was Zombieland: Double Tap. <|endoftext|> Got it, I think I have a couple options you might like. When you watch a movie, do you often also watch the sequel if one comes out? <|endoftext|> It depends. I think with how frequent sequels have become, I've lost interest in keeping up with watching the sixth, seventh, etc. iteration of primarily the same story. <|endoftext|> One I might recommend is Joker, it is a type of sequel, but really looks to look peer into a character from a different perspective. <|endoftext|> That is a good recommendation, I've seen it. <|endoftext|> Since you've already seen it, would you like another recommendation? <|endoftext|> I would, actually. Thank you. <|endoftext|> Well, it is not quite out yet, and it is the umpteenth release in a series, but if you've seen all of the initial Star Wars movies, I would recommend the trailer for Star Wars:  The Rise of Skywalker. With the Star Wars series being what it is, I find it will be a must-see movie as someone who appreciates Sci-fi. <|endoftext|> Star Wars has been a series I've kept up most with, repeatedly watching the original trilogy as a child. I will definitely check it out. <|endoftext|> As a Sci-fi fan, I had presumed that you had. You mentioned seeing the original trilogy multiple times, how do you think episodes I-III compare with the originals. <|endoftext|> That is seemingly a heavily debated question... I'd have to ask. The original trilogy feels like a more ambitious feat, for when it was made & how. <|endoftext|> I would agree. How do you think episodes 7-8 compare with 1-3? <|endoftext|> I don't think I've properly watched 7-8 to give an appropriate review. <|endoftext|> That is fair enough. Time will also tell. Would you like to watch the movie trailer for Star Wars 9? <|endoftext|> Per your recommendation, I will definitely check it out later. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey! How's it going? <|endoftext|> Pretty good, and you? <|endoftext|> Doing great! I guess we are gonna talk about some movies. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Horror movies, action movies, stoner comedies, I like a lot of movies. <|endoftext|> Same! Have you seen the Conjuring? <|endoftext|> I have, its been awhile though. I dont think I ever saw the sequels. <|endoftext|> Yeah I think I saw one of them, but the Conjuring was definitely the scariest. Whats the last move you watched? <|endoftext|> I think the last movie I watched was Knives Out. <|endoftext|> I saw that one too! Did you like it? <|endoftext|> I did, way better than I expected. But since, I know how it ends I dont think I will watch it again. <|endoftext|> I'd agree with that. I'm gonna click this got it button now, I think I've got some recommendations for you. <|endoftext|> Ok cool! <|endoftext|> Ok i <|endoftext|> what do you mean? I think you hit send too soon. <|endoftext|> I did haha, sorry! I've selected the movie game night. Not sure if it shows it to you. Its a comedy thriller about a game night gone wrong! <|endoftext|> I remember seeing the trailer for that. Never got around to watching it though. I think I'll watch that, thanks for your help! <|endoftext|> Totally! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Me too! Good talking to you <|endoftext|> Good talking to you too! Anything else movie related I can help you with? <|endoftext|> No I think thats it. <|endoftext|> Sounds good, have a good one and enjoy your movies! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How can I help you today? <|endoftext|> Hello. I am doing great. how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing fine, thank you. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like action movies. specifically ones that have comedy <|endoftext|> Woah! I love those movies too! Have you seen Catch Me If You can with Leonardo DiCaprio? <|endoftext|> I have! that is a great movie <|endoftext|> It's one of my favorites. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Bad Boy 3 was the last movie I watched. Do you have a recommendation of an action movie that has comedy? <|endoftext|> I would recommend Zombieland Double Tap. It has a lot of action and comedy, I would say 50% of both. I think that might be a great fit for you! <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great idea! I saw the trailer. Yes, I accept your recommendation for Zombieland Double tap <|endoftext|> Excellent. I think that's a great choice. Happy watching! <|endoftext|> Thank you and take care! <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch another movie too? <|endoftext|> Can you please tell me more about Zombieland? Who are the actors in the movie? <|endoftext|> The actors are Zoey Deutch, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, Bill Murray all great actors with excellent chemistry on screen. <|endoftext|> How long is the movie? <|endoftext|> The plot for the movie is Columbus, Tallahasse, Wichita, and Little Rock move to the American heartland as they face off against evolved zombies, fellow survivors, and the growing pains of the snarky makeshift family. and Zombieland is exactly 1 hour and 39 minutes long. The perfect amount of time to pass and yet not waste your whole day! <|endoftext|> That sounds very interesting. What rating have others given the movie? <|endoftext|> It has pretty good ratings, IMDb gave it a 6.8 and Rotten Tomatoes critic's gave it a 68%. However, the audience score from rotten tomatoes was almost 90%! Which is very high! I think it would be a great movie for you. <|endoftext|> Why was the rotten tomatoes critic score so low? <|endoftext|> Some critic's felt that most of the jokes were mere one-liners and unoriginal. However, most critics felt they enjoyed this movie even more than the original movie. One critic said QUOTATION_MARKDouble Tap is a worthy sequel that constitutes everything you could realistically hope for from a big-budget, mainstream zombie comedy.QUOTATION_MARK You really can't get more positive than that! Would you like for me to get this movie for you? <|endoftext|> yes please get that movie for me! I accept your recommendation!!! <|endoftext|> Great. I will get it now. Let me know if you need any more recommendations! <|endoftext|> THANK YOU! Goodbye! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Do you like the new Jumanji Movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, I like the movie. But I liked the original with Robin Williams the best. <|endoftext|> I agree the new reboots seem to mess up the old ones. <|endoftext|> I mean I love the Rock, he was great. But the new reboots have such a different story really. I think they are funnier than the first. <|endoftext|> They can be funny to me thats a fact <|endoftext|> I enjoy when Jack Black plays a girl, he is funny. I think I like the first one of the new reboot better than the second one that just came out. The animals in the first one seemed to be the stars of the movie, but in the new ones it's the stars. <|endoftext|> True lol best movie parts are key to draw in the population. <|endoftext|> I am looking for a recommendation for a movie about baseball that is funny, can be men or women. Do you know of any funny ones? <|endoftext|> Everybody Wants Some!! Is a good one <|endoftext|> I have never heard of that one. I will have to look that one up. Thank you. <|endoftext|> Ok it got 87%tomatos <|endoftext|> Who is in the movie? <|endoftext|> Blake Jenner,Justin Street,Ryan Guzman,and Tyler Hoechlin. <|endoftext|> Don't know those guys, new? <|endoftext|> More or less like 2016 new <|endoftext|> Is it a made up team or a current one? <|endoftext|> Current one <|endoftext|> Cool, which team? It has a high rotten tomatoes, was it a hit for the stars? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey how are you? <|endoftext|> good and yourself? im looking for a movie recommendation, something funny but with action <|endoftext|> im great! have you ever watched MIB( men in black)? <|endoftext|> yea i was thinking something newer <|endoftext|> theres a MIB international its pretty new. if not avengers endgame? <|endoftext|> i havent seen that one that might be good to see so ill pick this recommendation, did see endgame though! <|endoftext|> yes, it was amazing! ending was pretty sad though <|endoftext|> oh i kinda figured it would be the same as the original just kinda mordernized <|endoftext|> no it following the same plot but was different at the end <|endoftext|> ah, well sounds like thats the trailer ill be looking for , i just really remember will smith from the original <|endoftext|> whats one of your favorite movies? <|endoftext|> fear and loathing in las vegas or goodfellas from growing up, youtself? <|endoftext|> i dont really have a favorite as long as it has either action, comedy or romance im good <|endoftext|> i watch more tv shows thee days <|endoftext|> my favorite shows right now are chicago p.d, fire, and med. or any doctor show, power is also one of my favorites so is the orginals. whats ur favorite show? <|endoftext|> im watching rick and morty and the last season of supernatural at tthis very moment, and shameless <|endoftext|> ohh never watched them but ive heard a lot about them <|endoftext|> rick and morty is more senseless humor, i spend most my time paying more attention to my phone anyway lol <|endoftext|> oh lol <|endoftext|> should let us complete :/ <|endoftext|> it should lol <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm Rachel. How is your day? <|endoftext|> I'm doing very well. And you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great, thanks. What have you been doing? <|endoftext|> Not much. It's my day off, so I'm looking for movie recommendations. <|endoftext|> Oh very cool. What do you do for a living? <|endoftext|> I'm a therapist at a college. <|endoftext|> Oh wow. So what kinda movies are you usually into? <|endoftext|> I like slow, introspective movies. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah? What is some movies that you have recently seen and enjoyed? <|endoftext|> Some of my favorite films are Children of Men and Arrival. I guess I'm into slow science fiction, but I'm fine with any genre as long as the pacing allows me to sit and reflect. <|endoftext|> Have you heard of Knowing? It is a really good movie. It takes a little bit to build up to it but it is very exciting. It stars Nicholas Cage. <|endoftext|> I have not heard of it. What's it about? <|endoftext|> It is about a man that comes across a letter from the past and starts putting together that it foretells future disasters. He finds out the world will end soon but no one listens until its too late. <|endoftext|> Oh, that sounds absolutely fascinating. Have any other films in that vein? <|endoftext|> Nope it is the only one. It came out in 2009 <|endoftext|> You got it. What do you like most about it? <|endoftext|> I like the suspense and the uncertainty. <|endoftext|> That sounds awesome. You have a trailer you can send me? <|endoftext|> Yes sure no problem <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Hi, I'm good thanks. What movie trailer would you recommend? <|endoftext|> That depends on what kind of movies you like, what is your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Comedy <|endoftext|> Do you prefer older or newer movies? <|endoftext|> It doesn't matter which, as long as it is a funny movie with an interesting plot line. <|endoftext|> Ah, do you prefer dark or feel good comedy? <|endoftext|> Feel good comedy <|endoftext|> What's the most recent movie you've watched that you really liked? <|endoftext|> The South Park Movie, that was really funny. <|endoftext|> Did it send the recommendation? <|endoftext|> No, I didn't see one <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Happytime Murders? <|endoftext|> I haven't, is it funny? <|endoftext|> I enjoyed the cheesy one liners and had a few good laughs at the unexpected things in it. <|endoftext|> Excellent, I'll give it a try <|endoftext|> Wonderful, I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> I accept the recommendation <|endoftext|> Hmm, something must be off in this chat box. <|endoftext|> Seems like it, I did explicitly accept the recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there. <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you prefer to watch? <|endoftext|> I love romance and chick flicks <|endoftext|> Could you tell me what the last movie you watched was? <|endoftext|> It was a family movie, Firehouse Fun. Something about firefighters taking care of kids. <|endoftext|> Do you prefer shows that have romance between heroes like firefighterss? <|endoftext|> That would be a good combo <|endoftext|> Would you prefer something newer or older ? <|endoftext|> Classic movies are my favorite <|endoftext|> I suggest Fireproof. It is not quite a classic movie but is a firefighter romance <|endoftext|> Oooh, that sounds wonderful. I haven't seen it before. <|endoftext|> I love that its all about his struggle to save his marriage and that he is willing to fight for it . <|endoftext|> Thank you. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it. It is something I personally would watch as well <|endoftext|> I plan on watching it tonight. <|endoftext|> I may just have to watch it again myself. I really hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> You should watch it. <|endoftext|> I think I will. I ordered pizza tonight so pizza and a movie sounds great. <|endoftext|> I'm having baked chicken with my movie. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> Hi! How's it going? <|endoftext|> Pretty good. How about you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. I'm looking to find some interesting movie trailers. Do you have any that you would recommend? I'm into comedies and action movies. <|endoftext|> Hm. Do you like <|endoftext|> What was the recommendation? <|endoftext|> Sorry haha. I was trying to ask if you like Jumanji <|endoftext|> Yes I do. I accept your recommendation! Thank you! I am going to click Done now! <|endoftext|> We still should keep chatting lol <|endoftext|> Yes I agree haha. Are there other movies you like? <|endoftext|> I really like Hacksaw Ridge. That's more of a reenactment documentary, though. <|endoftext|> Oh, are you into documentaries mostly? I do enjoy documentaries occasionally. <|endoftext|> Yes! Mostly nature stuff, but war documentaries are so interesting! <|endoftext|> I see, I'm interested by the documentaries about the financial crisis and nutrition lol <|endoftext|> That's interesting. Not many people are interested in that <|endoftext|> Yes, I think it exposes a lot of what happened in 2008 <|endoftext|> was that when the market crashed? <|endoftext|> Yes it was! <|endoftext|> Ok, I will press done now :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? I'm curious to hear if you have a recommendation for a movie. <|endoftext|> sure i have some movies to recommend for you. I just need to know your preferences. <|endoftext|> The last QUOTATION_MARKgreatQUOTATION_MARK movie I watched was Midsommar. I'm a huge fan of Alamo Drafthouse Movie Parties because often times the plots and themes seemingly have all been done before. <|endoftext|> oh I see. do you like action or horror movies? <|endoftext|> Truthfully I am a documentary fan. Just a splash of sci-fi or horror. Midsommar to be was more of a really unusual acid trip (lol!) than a horror IMO. <|endoftext|> lol i can recommend some documentaries. what kind do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> History. Pirates. Tales of the ocean/boating/island life. <|endoftext|> ok. i have a movie to recommend. how about pirates of the carribbean. <|endoftext|> I've seen all of those and the one with Keith Richards was my favorite. <|endoftext|> ok. do you want me to recommend that or something else. <|endoftext|> I'm comfortable with that recommendation as I haven't watched those in several years and it would be fun to re-visit them. <|endoftext|> ok. i will recommend one of those movies. how is pirates of the carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl <|endoftext|> That's great. Thank you! <|endoftext|> your welcome i just recommended it. <|endoftext|> Is there any other similar movie you can think of off the top of your head? <|endoftext|> pirates of the carribbean <|endoftext|> Wasn't there a 3rd Pirates of The Caribbean as well? I get them confused. Dead Men Tell No Tales or something like that? <|endoftext|> yes, pirates of the carribbean dead men tell no tales <|endoftext|> There may have been four or five at this point... Still under ten of those movies in that franchise though, oddly enough. I wonder if they will release any more. <|endoftext|> probably you never know. it is hard to say. <|endoftext|> True. It's been great chatting with you today but it's after 9 and I am at work. Have a great day and happy holidays! <|endoftext|> you too. thank you so much. merry christmas. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. Are you interested in any trailers? <|endoftext|> Hi! Yes. I'm looking for a movie to go to with my family this week. What do you recommend? <|endoftext|> What kind of genres are you interested in? <|endoftext|> I love Romantic Comedies. My family tends to enjoy comedies, action movies and period movies. What do you like? <|endoftext|> I am a big horror fan. There are a lot of good romantic comedies I can recommend though. <|endoftext|> Oh cool, thanks! I get freaked out by horror movies, but what are your favorites? <|endoftext|> I love classic ones. I like The Shining (1980) and An American Werewolf in London (1981) <|endoftext|> Hmmm. I've never seen either of those. What Romantic Comedies do you recommend, if any? <|endoftext|> I think Untamed Heart would be a great one for you. <|endoftext|> What is that about? Is it in theaters? <|endoftext|> It is not in theaters. It came out in the early nineties. 1992 I think. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, what is it about? <|endoftext|> It is about a man who falls in love with a girl who works at the same restaurant as him <|endoftext|> Hmmmm that sounds interesting. But if we are looking for something more current, what would you recommend? <|endoftext|> I think you might like Long Shot from 2019 <|endoftext|> I saw that one over the summer, it was great! <|endoftext|> There is also Love, Simon <|endoftext|> I saw that one as well, as was not a huge fan. <|endoftext|> 500 Days of Summer is always a laugh <|endoftext|> That sounds familiar, what is it about ? <|endoftext|> A man has to figure out his life after his girlfriend dumps him <|endoftext|> Hmmm. I think I will check that out, thank you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> I am pretty open to a bunch of different genres. What would you suggest offhand? <|endoftext|> I would suggest romantic comedies, because they usually have a feel good story while letting you laugh. How does that sound? <|endoftext|> Romcoms are ok but maybe something in a drama or thriller would be more to my liking. <|endoftext|> Are we talking dramas like The Notebook? or Michael Clayton? <|endoftext|> More like crime or courtroom type dramas. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Michael Clayton? <|endoftext|> No I have not. What is it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a QUOTATION_MARKfixerQUOTATION_MARK for a law firm, and he is assigned to a multitude of tasks where he utilizes loopholes and connections for his employers. It stars George Clooney, and was nominated for a number of Academy Awards. <|endoftext|> Wow, that sounds like it could be really good.I think I'll give it a go. I accept your recommendation. Thanks <|endoftext|> You're welcome <|endoftext|> Do you have maybe another one since that one seems good? <|endoftext|> I would suggest another movie Erin Brockovich if you have not seen that one either. Being based on true story on true story about a small town woman can win against a corporation <|endoftext|> I have seen that one and really liked it. Know of any others that are similar? <|endoftext|> A classic would be The Firm that stars Tom Cruise, based on the novel of the same name. It focuses more on a scandal of a law firm, but still has some great drama and thrilling elements <|endoftext|> I have seen that but it was so long ago I don't really remember much about it. I might have to see it again. Do you have anymore? Maybe one more? <|endoftext|> Lincoln Lawyer is one of my personal favorites, probably due to the theme of loyalty that is all throughout the film. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> That is one I have thought about watching before but I never have. Do you think that is the best of the ones you've suggested? <|endoftext|> If I had to choose between Michael Clayton and the Lincoln Lawyer, I would choose Michael Clayton. I like watching big businesses not get away with crimes, rather than wealthy families getting away with them. That is just my personal preference. <|endoftext|> Michael Clayton it is then. Thank you for the recommendation. Much appreciated. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> Hi how are you doing ? <|endoftext|> Doing well. How about you? <|endoftext|> i am very good thank you <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i mostly like crime and adventure type of movies . can you recommend me any latest good one ? <|endoftext|> Of course I can! Who's your favorite actor/actress? <|endoftext|> I love to watch  jesson stetham , liam neson and renaldo dekeprio <|endoftext|> Those are great choices! What's the most recent movie you've watched? <|endoftext|> Ip man 4 <|endoftext|> What about Wild Card? It's about a Las Vegas bodyguard with lethal skills and a gambling problem who gets in trouble with the mob. It stars Jason Stratham. <|endoftext|> thats would be great i would love to watch , thank you so much have good one <|endoftext|> Glad to hear! I hope you enjoy your movie. Is there anything else I can do for you today? <|endoftext|> no thank you <|endoftext|> Awesome! <|endoftext|> what about tv series ? <|endoftext|> Do you like the same genres of TV? <|endoftext|> yes mostly crime <|endoftext|> Law and Order SUV is my personal go to crime TV series <|endoftext|> that looks great . what about prison break i heard alot about that ? <|endoftext|> I love that one too <|endoftext|> thats good ill watch both <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, I understand you are trying to find a movie trailer that interests you? <|endoftext|> Yes, I am! Do you have any recommendations for what's out there?What does everyone seem to want to see? <|endoftext|> There are all kinds of things out right now- what kind of movies do you like to see? Are there any genres that you don't like? <|endoftext|> Well, I'm not into science fiction at all. Historical fiction is a favorite. Not really wanting to see something sad. I don't like a lot of violence and language. I guess I'm in the mood for a feel good movie. Dramas are good too as long as the plot is interesting. <|endoftext|> I see! I also enjoy feel good movies and understand what you mean about dramas- sometimes the plot can be a little lacking! What is the last movie you watched if you don't mind my asking? <|endoftext|> I last saw Little Women. It was good. I liked most of the actors. Maybe now I'm looking for something with a little more adventure. Animal movies are good too!.....not cartoon tho. <|endoftext|> Little Women was a great movie! The costume design in the movie was well thought out and totally deserved to win the academy award for best costume design. I also enjoyed the score of that movie. Can you expand a bit more on what you mean by animal movies, especially since you said you don't care for animation? <|endoftext|> I have read some books that were made into movies that involved animals. Like QUOTATION_MARKA Dog's PurposeQUOTATION_MARK. Very well done,but that was a while ago. Just thought there might be something similar out. <|endoftext|> I understand! Have you read anything about the new Dolittle movie? It just recently came out in January so is relatively new. If not, what is it about that movie that disinterests you? <|endoftext|> Oh yea! I haven't really read anything recently, but isn't that the one with Robert Downey Jr.?nWhat is it rated? <|endoftext|> It is! It is rated PG, so a little more geared towards children however it combines action & adventure with comedy- a feel good movie you might say! <|endoftext|> Hey! I  think that is a great idea! As long as it's not rated G, it works for me. Not a fan of sitting in a theater with a bunch of little kids. I do like me some Robert Downey Jr! :) I will take your recommendation! Thank You! <|endoftext|> Great! I sure hope you enjoy it! He is a great actor. I do feel that this one is the best adaptation of all of the Dolittle movies. Have you seen any of the older ones? <|endoftext|> Yes, I saw the one with the guy from My Fair Lady, but that was a long time ago. Thanks again. <|endoftext|> Yeah the other ones are pretty old and not my favorite to be honest. Did you ever seen the original one? It won a bunch of awards back in the day! <|endoftext|> Not sure if it was the original or not, but it was the musical one. I actually liked it very mucn but I like musicals. They don't have many of those anymore. Mama Mia was good! Like most movies they should quit while they are ahead because the second one wasn't so good. Same thing happened with Grease. <|endoftext|> Agreed! I was disappointed by the second Mama Mia as well, but know some who enjoyed it. I never did see the next Grease- what did you not like about it? <|endoftext|> It did not have the original cast and the music just didn't have a spark. <|endoftext|> That is a shame. Well I hope Dolittle does not disappoint you! Thanks for chatting with me today. Think you will watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I absolutely will! I think I've already made up my mind tho. Nice chatting to you as well! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> what was the last movie you have seen? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw was Gangs of New York by Martin Scorsese. I'm looking for a recommendation for another movie trailer like that. <|endoftext|> that is a great movie. I would recommend Casino. thats another great Martin Scorsese movie. <|endoftext|> I have always wanted to see that, but still haven't. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> He is a master of that genre of movie <|endoftext|> Yes, I really enjoy sweeping epic films with historical settings. What is your favorite one of his films? <|endoftext|> I think at the moment it would be Goodfellas <|endoftext|> That's a classic. Have you seen his latest, The Irishman? I have read it shares many qualities with both Goodfellas and Casino. <|endoftext|> not yet but i hear it great <|endoftext|> Yes, I'm very excited to see it. Even though it is so long. <|endoftext|> How long is the movie? <|endoftext|> Three and a half hours, I believe. <|endoftext|> Wow. That is long <|endoftext|> Yeah. What is the runtime for Casino? I believe that one is also quite long. <|endoftext|> 2hrs and 58 minutes <|endoftext|> That's almost as long as the Irishman! I like movies with some length though -- they give the characters time to fully develop and the plot time to really simmer. <|endoftext|> That is so true. Just Like the Godfather movie <|endoftext|> Yes, that's a perfect example. Thank you so much for your recommendations. <|endoftext|> Have a nice day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I am here to help you find a movie, do you know what kind of movie you are interested in? <|endoftext|> I am interested in sci fi movies but horror are also acceptable <|endoftext|> Have you recently watched a sci-fi or horror movie you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I have been watching alot of horror lately, IT chapter 2 was good <|endoftext|> Stephen King provides some thrilling content for movies! Are you a fan of his? <|endoftext|> Yea I have read alot of his work and seen most of his films, the new pet sematary was pretty decent and I am looking forward to the TommyKnockers adaptation <|endoftext|> Agreed, it should be a good combination of science fiction and horror! What did you enjoy most about pet seminary? <|endoftext|> It managed to stay true to the source material, whilst changing a few key elements to keep it fresh and update it for a new audience <|endoftext|> Do you follow Stephen King on social media? He has a list of movies he personally recommends. <|endoftext|> I didnt know that he did that, what kinds of movies does he reccomend <|endoftext|> He recommends new indie horror movies to his fans, I'd recommend checking out QUOTATION_MARKThe Autopsy of Jane DoeQUOTATION_MARK. <|endoftext|> I loved the autopsy of jane doe it was one of my favorite new horror films <|endoftext|> It's the #1 recommendation. I'd also recommend Book of Shadows: The Blair Witch 2 <|endoftext|> I havent seen Blair Witch 2 but I was not a big fan of the first one <|endoftext|> Yeah, if you didn't enjoy the first one I'd stay away from it too. Have you seen STIR OF ECHOES? <|endoftext|> I dont think I have, Kevin Bacon right? <|endoftext|> Yes! It's a supernatural film based on a novel. I remember you said you like sci fi movies and this is based on a novel like Stephen King so it could be a good one to check out. <|endoftext|> I will check out a trailer for it thanks I accept this recomenndation <|endoftext|> Awesome! I'd also check out Stir of Echoes: The Homecoming, it came out in 2007 and is a thriller. <|endoftext|> Isnt it based on a game too? or smething like that <|endoftext|> Lots of horror and thrillers feel like games of who is going to survive. You'll have to watch both! The saying for the sequel is QUOTATION_MARKThis time, the door cannot be lockedQUOTATION_MARK. Que horror music. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good Morning <|endoftext|> Good morning <|endoftext|> Hope you enjoyed you holiday. I am here to help you look for  movie trailer <|endoftext|> I'm into horror movies and thrillers <|endoftext|> what is the last mvie you seen <|endoftext|> Clover field paradox <|endoftext|> That was a good movie. I am into horror movies also. My favorite!!! do you want a similar movie trailer that is in the same catagory as cloverfield? <|endoftext|> I would love too see an other trailer <|endoftext|> do you what drama or action? <|endoftext|> I like action more <|endoftext|> I like ction too <|endoftext|> That's cool. What movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like horror, drama and sction <|endoftext|> Any movies you could recommend me? <|endoftext|> DO you like watching movies with keanu reeves? <|endoftext|> Omg absolutely I love that actor <|endoftext|> Since you said you like action and Keanu Reeves here is a good movie <|endoftext|> That is correct <|endoftext|> How about John Wick? It is about an ex-hit man and full of action, plus Keanu Reeves is the main actor. I believe you would really enjoy this movie. <|endoftext|> Thank you. Looks like I made my choice thank you <|endoftext|> You welcome. Hope you enjoy the mocie <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! What is your favorite type of movie? <|endoftext|> My favorite type of movie is murder/mystery. <|endoftext|> Ooo those are fun! What's your favorite murder/mystery movie you've seen recently? <|endoftext|> 21 Bridges <|endoftext|> That's the same guy that plays in Black Panther, right? Did you like it? <|endoftext|> Yes, it is Chadwick Boseman and the movie is absolutely great - it could be considers a Suspense/Thriller - Simply outstanding - produced by the Russo Brother who also worked with Chadwick on Black Panther. <|endoftext|> If his acting is anywhere near as good as it is in Black Panther and the production is similar I'm sure it was great! I personally like a wide range of movies, just depends on how I'm feeling at the moment. Recently I've been watching more action movies. <|endoftext|> Great! I tend to stay towards the Murder/Mystery. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any other murder/mystery movies recently? <|endoftext|> Yes, I recently watched a 1991 movie called Dead Again with Kenneth Branagh - I recommend this trailer and movie. <|endoftext|> Hm, never heard of that. Have you ever seen In Darkness with Natalie Dormer? I absolutely love her as an actress ever since I saw her in Game of Thrones. <|endoftext|> NO, I have not seen it. However, I just watched a trailer and it is one that I would want to see. It is a good recommendation based on what I saw. <|endoftext|> I like that it has a good balance and keeps you on your toes! What is Dead Again about? <|endoftext|> Dead Again is like a murder reincarnation as an amnesiac and a private investigator echos a 1940s murder case. You should check out a trailer. <|endoftext|> I will definitely do that! <|endoftext|> Since you have accepted my recommendation to check out the trailer and I took time to watch the trailer of  your recommendation and it seems like a movie I would probably check out - is this chat basically over as I do not have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Basically. Thank you for the recommendation. It definitely looks like a classic! <|endoftext|> Great chatting and learning about more movies. Thanks! <|endoftext|> You're welcome, and I hope you have a great rest of your day! <|endoftext|> Same to you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I will be helping you with finding a movie you will love today! <|endoftext|> Great. I enjoy action movies. I also enjoy drama and maybe a little romance. <|endoftext|> What's your opinion on movies about race cars? <|endoftext|> They are ok, I guess. I don't seek them out on purpose. Not really my favorite. <|endoftext|> How about martial arts? <|endoftext|> Oh, yes. I do enjoy martial arts movies. I appreciate when there is a little culture or history involved in a movie. <|endoftext|> I would recommend watching The Karate Kid if you haven't seen it yet! The 1984 version of the movie. <|endoftext|> I have. I tend to shy away from remakes. I sometimes feel it is degrading to the integrity of the original. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I don't think the remake was done well at all. <|endoftext|> I enjoyed the Kill Bill series. It had the perfect ammount of fantasy. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Jason Bourne? <|endoftext|> Is that new? I have seem many of the Bourne movies but I can't keep track of them all. <|endoftext|> No it is from 2016 <|endoftext|> I am not sure if I have seen it. I like some sci fi too. Any suggestions in that genre? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Ender's Game? <|endoftext|> I have not. It sounds interesting. I think I will go with that one! <|endoftext|> The movie won an award for best display <|endoftext|> Awesome, thanks for your help. <|endoftext|> Yup, no problem the movie was based off of the book. Which was also pretty good. <|endoftext|> Ah, I am not the most avid reader. I wish I was. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how can I help you today? <|endoftext|> I'm ready to chat <|endoftext|> So what genre of filmss do you like? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw in the theaters was 21 Bridges. It was great. <|endoftext|> Ok so I take it you like action and crime flicks then. Did you see The Gentleman yet? <|endoftext|> no I didn't see it <|endoftext|> It looks really good and has an amazing cast. Matthew Mcconaughey and Charlie Hunnan play a couple of gangsters in a british crime ring working to maintain their turf in Guy Ritchie's slightly comedic style. It's created by the same director behind Snatch and the Sherlock Holmes films with Robert Downey Jr. if you have seen any of those. <|endoftext|> Your description is fantastic. I can see why you enjoyed the film. <|endoftext|> Ok so what is the worst film you have seen in recent memory <|endoftext|> There's no bad movie I've seen in recent years. <|endoftext|> So what do you feel like watching? <|endoftext|> I don't have any in mind. How about you? <|endoftext|> Why not go with an action adventure film? <|endoftext|> That's a great idea. Do you have any in mind? <|endoftext|> Why not try the Sherlock Holmes Film I recommended earlier? <|endoftext|> I'll consider it. Thanks. <|endoftext|> Is there anything else I can help you with? <|endoftext|> I recommend you see 21 Bridges. The star is Chadwick Boseman whose character chases 2 cop killers and must catch them before they get out of New York. <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> You're welcome. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how's it going <|endoftext|> Great, and you? <|endoftext|> pretty good. So what kinds of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I love Action movies like Star Wars or Fast 4/ <|endoftext|> I really like star wars too have you seen the newer ones? and did you like them better than te originals or not? I really like the dynamic between rae and ben. <|endoftext|> I like the scenery the best, and I also love the characters such as Luke Skywalker and Ben. The scenery is pivotal I think, and I enjoy this aspect in action movies. <|endoftext|> do you really like things that are sci-fi then and based in space? have you seen Ad Astra? <|endoftext|> No, I have not seen that. And I do love movies that are based in space and have action too. <|endoftext|> There are a few sci-f movies that came out in 2019 you might like then and also a few that are soon to come out. Do you enjoy Avengers or superheros in space? <|endoftext|> I love Avengers and superheroes in space. What movies are there that you would say are great for me? <|endoftext|> captain Marvel was good <|endoftext|> I would like some recommendations from you for action, sci-fi, and I also love comedy. I also like some romance. So either of those are perfect. <|endoftext|> The Host is all of those things if you haven't already seen it <|endoftext|> I have not heard of it. What do you like about it that is interesting? Any others? <|endoftext|> it's about a girl trying to protect the people she loves. something is taking over humans minds and bodies causing them to forget everything. It's kind of a love conquers all type of film with aliens. <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting! I woud love to see it! <|endoftext|> There is also a movie called jupiter ascending with Channing tatum and Mila Kunis. It is 100% a rom-com Sci-fi. They go to space to fightthe bad guy and fall in love along the way. Channing Tatum is there to protect her as she finds out the truth about who she is and her families history. <|endoftext|> The movie name sounds really good. I would love to see it actually. Is it new? <|endoftext|> it came out in 2015 <|endoftext|> I need to see that one! Thanks so much for recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi how are you <|endoftext|> Hello.

I was a little disappointed with the second one... <|endoftext|> im sure the last one will be great <|endoftext|> All the elements are there. Interested in seeing an exciting trailer for an upcoming film? <|endoftext|> sure   send it  im interested <|endoftext|> Here's the latest one of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> great preview cant wait <|endoftext|> On its way! <|endoftext|> please send the clip <|endoftext|> Working... working... working... I feel a little like a malfunctioning droid... <|endoftext|> ok r2d2 <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, you're looking for a movie? <|endoftext|> Hi, yes I am! I would love to watch a movie that's suspenseful and maybe a psychological thriller. Do you know of any movies like that? <|endoftext|> Sure, what types of thrillers have you liked <|endoftext|> I really liked Shutter Island! <|endoftext|> I did too. WHat did you like about it <|endoftext|> Well, I always love watching Leonardo DiCaprio because he's a great actor. But the plotline was interesting and had a lot of unexpected twists in it that I liked, especially the end. What did you like? <|endoftext|> I like diCaprio too, and i agree that it was suspenseful. Do you like most of his movies <|endoftext|> I do like most of his movies. Do you have any recommendations for any of his other films you think I might like? <|endoftext|> Inception was suspenseful, cerebral and had DiCaprio. Plus Django Unchained <|endoftext|> Inception sounds like a great movie. I'll accept your recommendation to watch that movie. Thanks for the help! <|endoftext|> You'll like it, i think <|endoftext|> Yeah, I have heard it is a great movie. The soundtrack is also supposed to be pretty epic! <|endoftext|> Hans ZImmer has some good ones. Interstellar had a sad, intense soundtrack <|endoftext|> Didn't he also compose the Dark Knight soundtrack? <|endoftext|> Yeah, all three of those. He could probably compose and tour <|endoftext|> What other movie composers do you like? <|endoftext|> Phillip Glass, Bangalter, but  mostly I like classical music <|endoftext|> Bangalter is an interesting one. I know he did some work on another thriller, Irreversible. That was a pretty dark one <|endoftext|> I know, I love Noe and Von Trier, but they're tough to swallow <|endoftext|> I really like that Von Trier used Kirsten Dunst in Melancholia. She is really talented and can portray a lot of different characters. A lot of depth in her acting. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> I love streaming movies on my computer. I have a snow day and need a recoomedation of a movie to watch. <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I am not that particular. Depends on my mood. Today maybe I'd like to see an action movie. <|endoftext|> I recommend the Avengers <|endoftext|> Yes, I've seen bits and parts of several of these series. Which one is the best? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Avengers Endgame? <|endoftext|> Yes, I did see that one. I wasn't so impressed with this one. Do you know if the next one is available online yet? <|endoftext|> That is the latest movie. What didn't you like about it <|endoftext|> It was a bit hammy. Special effects were overly done - more bulky characters than splashy sparkling sky equipment. <|endoftext|> I recommend Midway. Do you accept? <|endoftext|> Can you give me a few details -plot, cast, genre? <|endoftext|> DescriptionOn Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese forces launch a devastating attack on Pearl Harbor, the U.S. naval base in Hawaii. Six months later, the Battle of Midway commences on June 4, 1942, as the Japanese navy once again plans a strike against American ships in the Pacific. It is the story of the Battle of Midway, told by the leaders and the sailors who fought it. Patrick Wilson, Luke Evans, Woody Harrelson, Dennis Quaid are in it. <|endoftext|> Wood Harrelson and Dennis Quad are wonderful. I am in. Thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> You're welcome! Hope you like it <|endoftext|> I am sure I will. Sometimes leading men are all I really want to see in a movie. <|endoftext|> Haha. Me too! <|endoftext|> Do you know if it is online, for free, yet? <|endoftext|> I am not sure about that <|endoftext|> I will look around for it. Nothing like a snow day to browse around. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> im looking for an action movie <|endoftext|> I love action movies. I recently watched QUOTATION_MARKFallen AngelQUOTATION_MARK. It is a great action movie. <|endoftext|> what is it about <|endoftext|> It is about a secret service agent who takes his job of protecting the president very seriously. It is the 3rd sequel but you don't have to have seen the first two to watch this movie. Of course, as with most movies, there is a conflict for the agent and he has to do QUOTATION_MARKwhatever it takesQUOTATION_MARK to protect the president. There is a LOT of action that I think you would like. I highly recommend it! <|endoftext|> what about a really gory action movie <|endoftext|> I would say this is fairly gory as a lot of people get blown up and there is a lot of hand to hand combat with stabbings and lots of shooting. Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> no i want a horror movie <|endoftext|> Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. I was thinking more action without the horror. How about Chainsaw Massacre? There is a lot of gore in that movie and it is very scary. <|endoftext|> but arent there several which one would you recommend <|endoftext|> Diary of the Dead is good gory horror movie you might like. It's definitely a thriller. <|endoftext|> whats it about <|endoftext|> Some young adults, film students, are filming a horror movie of their own but as an exciting twist, they encounter real-life zombies. <|endoftext|> whats a good family comedy <|endoftext|> A great family comedy is <|endoftext|> is what <|endoftext|> RV. Another one is any of the QUOTATION_MARKHome AloneQUOTATION_MARK series since it is around the holidays and kids love these movies. <|endoftext|> whats the plot of rb <|endoftext|> Well, first off it stars Robin Williams who is the father of a family of 4. He is frustrated that his children don't seem to be interested in spending quality family time due to technology so he rents an RV to travel across the country and camp. Many hilarious obstacles occur. It's great for the whole family. Would you like to watch that trailer? <|endoftext|> yes i would <|endoftext|> Excellent! It has been great chatting with you today. I hope you enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you get a movie recommendation. <|endoftext|> Glad to hear it! What do you have for me? <|endoftext|> Well first let me ask what sort of genre are you in the mood for today? <|endoftext|> Hmm, let's go for a comedy. <|endoftext|> Would you like a recent release or something older? <|endoftext|> Preferably something from this year. <|endoftext|> Do you mind M rated films or do you want something more kid friendly? <|endoftext|> No preference for that either. I'm just as open to an adult comedy as I would be to an animated movie from Pixar or something. <|endoftext|> Got it, Then my recommendations are Good Boys, Booksmart and Toy Story 4, do you want to hear more about any of these? <|endoftext|> I'm going to go for Toy Story 4. Thank you! <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah definitely. Okay, thank you! <|endoftext|> Glad I could help, we need to complete a 2-3 more turns <|endoftext|> How much did you like the original movie? <|endoftext|> It was one of my favorites as a kidm I wanted to be buzz <|endoftext|> Buzz is awesome. Woody and Jess were both awesome too. Honestly, the entire cast was great. <|endoftext|> Yes and I really liked the sequel as well <|endoftext|> Well, it has been good chatting with you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello friend. Are you looking for a movie to watch? <|endoftext|> I sure am, see any good ones lately? <|endoftext|> Several yes. How is your mood today? Looking for something light or serious? <|endoftext|> I think I'm pretty happy. Would like something light, y'know. <|endoftext|> Great. What's the last casual movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Frozen 2, if that counts. <|endoftext|> It does! Would you enjoy an animated film, or something more grownup today? <|endoftext|> I guess more QUOTATION_MARKGrown-upQUOTATION_MARK, haha. <|endoftext|> How would you feel about QUOTATION_MARKPlaying With FireQUOTATION_MARK? It's a light comedy/family movie and stars John Cena. <|endoftext|> I'd be interested! What's it about? <|endoftext|> A group of firefighters rescue three young kids and are stuck babysitting them, but they aren't very good at it. Shenanigans ensure. <|endoftext|> That sounds fun! I think I'd see that one if I go. <|endoftext|> I'm sorry. It appears that movie is not available. A similar option is Daddy's Home 2, also starring John Cena as well as Mark Wahlberg & Will Ferrel. I think you would like this. I found it quite hilarious. <|endoftext|> Aww well, I guess Daddy's Home 2 sounds pretty good! I'll see that one, I like the actors. <|endoftext|> Fantastic! I think you will enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thanks! I think I will too, did you see it? <|endoftext|> I did. I enjoyed both of the Daddy's Home movies. <|endoftext|> Nice, I don't have to see the first one, right? <|endoftext|> No. The first one sets up the original plot, but you will not have any trouble following along. <|endoftext|> That's great than, thanks for the movie! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good Morning! How are you doing? <|endoftext|> Excellent, hope you are as well1 <|endoftext|> I'm doing pretty decently, thank you! What kind of movies are you generally interested in? <|endoftext|> Comedies mostly, but I do like some action! Any ideas? <|endoftext|> I may! What are a few of the last comedies you've watched? <|endoftext|> I just watched Good Boys, I found that pretty funny! <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy more slap-stick comedies or more stand-up? Do you have a specific type you don't like to watch? <|endoftext|> Slap stick is fine by me, I pretty much watch anything. The more offensive the better! <|endoftext|> I think you might enjoy Superbad or Sex Drive, both are pretty offensive and I personally thought they were hilarious. I'd watch them both again. <|endoftext|> Oh neat, I will check them both out. I accept those recommendations ! <|endoftext|> Excellent, Sex Drive didn't win any awards, but I feel like you don't really need awards to be a fun movie. What are your thoughts on that? <|endoftext|> I don't know awards presenters really QUOTATION_MARKgetQUOTATION_MARK comedy anyway! Not everything can be a winner. <|endoftext|> I also really like that it doesn't have any known actors, just a few people trying to make it. Do you enjoy those as well? <|endoftext|> I do actually, I can only take so many Seth Rogen comedies! I prefer the up and comers, get some new blood on the scene. <|endoftext|> Ugh, I'm getting so sick of them so I'm happy I didn't choose Superbad because he actually is in that one lol. This one is thankfully from 2008. <|endoftext|> It sounds right up my alley then! Just glad you didn't recommend the hangover movies either! <|endoftext|> No way, I actually didn't find them that funny personally. Offensive, yes, but I think it blurs that line. I'm a bit over seeing people dress up with that baby as well. <|endoftext|> Haha couldn't agree more, now we just need to get past the Harley Quinn trend. <|endoftext|> This one just has a giant donut costume, definitely not HQ! Hopefully you'll enjoy watching it. <|endoftext|> I think I will! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Sound good what are some recommendations? <|endoftext|> Great!

What did you like most about it? <|endoftext|> I enjoyed the original one the most. I liked it because it was scary, but also funny, so it was a comedy/horror mashup. The 2010 version was more horror as Freddy was not funny at all. <|endoftext|> Yes I totally agree. Do you like Psychological thrillers? <|endoftext|> I do enjoy those as well. What is your favorite one? <|endoftext|> The shining, have you ever seen it? I also really enjoy the QUOTATION_MARKusQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKget outQUOTATION_MARK. <|endoftext|> I saw QUOTATION_MARKGet OutQUOTATION_MARK . If you like that one, you might also like QUOTATION_MARKShutter IslandQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I just watched the trailer that looks really good. You haven't seen QUOTATION_MARKUsQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> I have, it really kept me at the edge of my seat. <|endoftext|> I agree. Jordan Peele is a fantastic director. What other Psychological thrillers do you recommend? <|endoftext|> I also recommend the movie QUOTATION_MARKSplitQUOTATION_MARK. You are constantly wondering who you are dealing with in this movie. <|endoftext|> I wanted to see that but I never did. <|endoftext|> I highly recommend watching it at least once. <|endoftext|> I will thanks! <|endoftext|> Great! Have a great evening! <|endoftext|> You as well! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you with finding a movie trailer <|endoftext|> hi, i am looking at the sonic the hedgehog movie. <|endoftext|> I was really impressed with the graphics that the movie utilized throughout. Jim Carey is a part of the movie. <|endoftext|> yeah, this movie looks awesome to watch. I would definitely want the trailer to that movie. <|endoftext|> Are there any other movies that you are interested in watching? <|endoftext|> yes, i like to see knives out. <|endoftext|> So you enjoy movies in the drama/mystery genre? <|endoftext|> sort of, I do.

Really cool!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey! I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi! That sounds great! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I love comedy and action movies. Anything that keeps me entertained and makes me laugh as well. <|endoftext|> Ok great! I'm just gonna ask a couple of questions. What is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was Frozen 2 <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie with similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> I would want a different one <|endoftext|> Ok awesome! Well recently I saw this movie called Peppermint. Do you like action dramas too? <|endoftext|> I like action dramas but I have not heard of this movie. What is it about? <|endoftext|> It's awesome! It's about this woman who goes on the hunt for revenge after her a horrible tragedy <|endoftext|> It doesn't really sound like the type of movie I would be interested in. Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Ok sure! and just wondering. What was it about frozen 2 that you really enjoyed the most? <|endoftext|> My kids watched the first one when they were a little younger so we all wanted to watch the secone one as a family. It was just something we did as a family. It's not my typical movie. <|endoftext|> Ok got it! And you did say you liked action dramas. What do you like most about those kinds of movies? <|endoftext|> I like that they keep you on the edge of your seat and they keep your attention during the whole movie. They also keep you guessing about what is going to happen next. <|endoftext|> Yeah totally. I'm the same way. I love suspense! <|endoftext|> Yes the suspense is the best part. <|endoftext|> That reminds me of this movie I saw recently called Us. It's a little bit of horror but it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It starts Lupita Nyong'o as the main character. Me and my friends watched it together and it's definitely something you won't forget <|endoftext|> I think I have heard of this movie. It sounds like something I would really like to see. I will definitely check this one out! <|endoftext|> That's great! You are going to love it! <|endoftext|> Accept <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, How are you? <|endoftext|> good, how are you <|endoftext|> I'm fantastic. <|endoftext|> that is great <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> funny movies, romance, drama, some action <|endoftext|> I like the same. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> at home or in theater <|endoftext|> First Theater then home. <|endoftext|> i cant think of the theater at the moment. I've seen some but not so recently. at home i have been watching holiday movies <|endoftext|> I think you should see the movie Longshot. It is a hilarious love story <|endoftext|> i like comedy love stories. I will see about watching this soon <|endoftext|> You wont regret it. It has Seth Rogan and Charlize Theron. It is easily one of the best movies I have seen all yearI love that it is a comedy and a romance.. <|endoftext|> Any other recommendation <|endoftext|> Good boys is another great comedy to see. <|endoftext|> probably more cute than funny <|endoftext|> Noooo Its hilarious. Its not what you think. I said the same thing. I laughed tears the entire time. <|endoftext|> boys first kiss and the girl next door, cute and funny <|endoftext|> Its almost like Superbad but with children. It really is a coming of age story about 12 year olds and what it is like growing up in todays times. It is about children but it is not a child movie. I'm actually laughing thinking about it. You wont be dissapointed. Another great movie to see right now is A beautiful day in the neighborhood- The Mr Rogers movie. Its nostalgic and I feel the best move of the year. Tom Hanks did an excellent job. <|endoftext|> Ok interesting that it is of today children coming of age. I love Tom Hanks but not so sure if I could do Mr. Rogers <|endoftext|> It is a heavy movie but very good. If you watched Mr Rogers growing up I suggest it. <|endoftext|> I think I'll go with Longshot, thank you for your recommendations <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you doing? <|endoftext|> I am doing great. How has your day been? <|endoftext|> It's been good! I had a pretty good day at work and now I'm just relaxing with my dogs <|endoftext|> I love dogs. I like to hang out and watch movies with my dog. Do you? <|endoftext|> I do! I love watching movies in general and enjoy all genres, but I've noticed one of my dogs always watches the tv when a scary movie is on, haha. <|endoftext|> Funny you say that because my dog does the same thing especially when I watched a comedy with dogs in it. It was funny because she kept tilting her head at the tv. <|endoftext|> Hahaha, that's hilarious. I think my dog just gets worried about what's happening whenever the intense music starts to play. <|endoftext|> Yes the music can be very intense! What scary movie did you recently watch that made your dog watch the movie as well? <|endoftext|> The most recent one I've noticed him watching was The Descent, which is kind of an older movie, but I watch it all the time at home. <|endoftext|> I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve never watched that one myself. Is it really scary? I am a big fan of thrillers, like Stephen king movies. <|endoftext|> I would say it's more of a thriller. There are some QUOTATION_MARKjump scaresQUOTATION_MARK in it but it's not completely terrifying. It's about these girls that go caving and end up getting trapped in the cave where there are monsters. It's pretty interesting. <|endoftext|> That actually sounds like something I would watch! I like those types of movies! One thriller I liked a lot was Get Out, very psychologic! More into those than blood and guts. <|endoftext|> Get Out was great! I love psychological thrillers as well, probably one of my favorite genres! <|endoftext|> Yes it was so interesting to see what was going to happen next! And the ending was pretty surprising! <|endoftext|> It was! It's great to see a movie that constantly keeps you guessing until the very end <|endoftext|> Are thrillers your favorite genre? I like them a lot but I love a good comedy! <|endoftext|> I would say thrillers are my favorite, but I'm not picky about genres! Comedies are great as well! <|endoftext|> Have you watched any of the saw movies? I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve not yet watched jigsaw but need to watch it. Even if it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds blood and guts. Those movies were always interesting to watch and unfold. <|endoftext|> I've watched the first 3 I believe, but nothing after that! I was interested in seeing Jigsaw but never got around to it <|endoftext|> Do you want to watch the trailer for it? Might get you excited to finally watch it like myself. <|endoftext|> Yes, I would love to! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hey! <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> I hear you're looking for a movie trailer reccomendation, do you have a genre prefrence? <|endoftext|> i like scifi <|endoftext|> What are some of your favorite sci-fi movies? <|endoftext|> interstellar.. gravity <|endoftext|> Have you considered annihilation? <|endoftext|> what is the plot? any sneakpeek? <|endoftext|> it's  about a woman who wants to find out what happened to her husband inside a mysterious area, think murder mystery with scifi influence. <|endoftext|> interesting!!.. i might give it a try <|endoftext|> it has an 88% on rotten tomatoes, if that matters. <|endoftext|> great.. who are the leads? <|endoftext|> Natalie portman, Bennedict Wong, Sonoya Mizunp, David Gyasi. <|endoftext|> interesting.. will plan it for this weekend <|endoftext|> would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> sure.. will try trailer is interesting.. <|endoftext|> do you like it or should i look for another reccomendation? <|endoftext|> i think i liked this much.. probably i ll go with this <|endoftext|> okay, have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello there i hear you are looking for an interesting movie trailer <|endoftext|> Yes this is correct!!! <|endoftext|> There are many great actors out there and a personal favorite of mine is leonardo dicaprio.

Do you have any movies lately by him? <|endoftext|> I most recently watched QUOTATION_MARKCatch me if you can.QUOTATION_MARK it was an amazing movie. very interesting that it was based on a true story <|endoftext|> What is that movie about? <|endoftext|> to quickly sum it up. dicaprio is playing a character who basically impersonates a bunch of different careers and ends up forging bank notes and illegally making money. he can outsmart anyone in order to be successful <|endoftext|> Who else is starring in this movie? <|endoftext|> theres lots of talented actors and actresses. tom hanks, amy adams, christopher walken. just to name a few <|endoftext|> Wow!!

I prefer more action packed movies though <|endoftext|> I didn't see that but I love Angelina Jolie! I bet you are a fan of the Avenger movies then? <|endoftext|> Oh yes!! They are some of my favorite. <|endoftext|> Do you prefer a lot of action upfront or slow suspense that builds into action? <|endoftext|> I like it to be action packed the whole way. <|endoftext|> Why do you like action? <|endoftext|> I like action because it is more of an escape from the day to day, <|endoftext|> You should see Max Max: Fury Road, have you <|endoftext|> Yes. I wasn't really impressed with that one, although it was very action packed. Next? <|endoftext|> What about Speed? <|endoftext|> I did like that one, but already seen it. <|endoftext|> The Age of Shadows is good...it's Korean <|endoftext|> Does it have subtitles? <|endoftext|> Yes it does <|endoftext|> I'm out on that one then. <|endoftext|> It got a 100% rating on Rotten Tomato <|endoftext|> I'm sure it is good, but I dont see well <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi!

Do you have a movie you've watched recently that you liked? <|endoftext|> Not really. Honestly movies can easily pu me to sleep so I like something engaging to hold my interest. A good example is The Matrix. <|endoftext|> I can tell you like a lot of suspense and action. Have you watched or thought about watching the Mission Impossible movies? Tom Cruise gives a great story! <|endoftext|> I have not watched or thought about those. That's a good suggestion I think. I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan but maybe I'd enjoy the films. <|endoftext|> Perhaps based off your enjoyment of Harry Potter you like a more fantasy style of action. I really love to watch Lord of the Rings with my family. It is a very wild and action filled plot set in another world with magic. Do you think those movies would interest you? <|endoftext|> Absolutely! I've seen them and although lengthy, I was captivated and enjoyed them a lot. I also am interested in anything about King Arthur or Merlin <|endoftext|> Amazing!

You have a great taste in movies and I think that you may really enjoy this movie. Is there any concerns you may have regarding my choice for you? <|endoftext|> Thank you for the sweet compliment. No concerns regarding your recommendation. I am going to try to find the movie. <|endoftext|> Awesome, I am so glad that I could help your search in your movie preferences. <|endoftext|> I wrote the title down so I will remember. ....Mortal Engines <|endoftext|> Haha I love that. Have a great day and Enjoy! <|endoftext|> Thanks so much. You have a great day also....by the way ....where are you right now?? I'm just curious.

It really made you think. If you like movies that are unpredictable, you would love it. <|endoftext|> is it a horror movie <|endoftext|> I would consider it to be a horror film, but not in the way of Saw or Friday the 13th. There are no monsters or anything, but it is definitely a thriller that catches you by surprise. <|endoftext|> i like enter the void <|endoftext|> Is it a horror movie <|endoftext|> no its about drugs and death <|endoftext|> do you have a favorite genre of movie <|endoftext|> science fiction <|endoftext|> Have you seen Interstellar <|endoftext|> that sounds good Ill watch that <|endoftext|> My family loves science fiction and all loved this movie <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> Hey. I'm looking for a movie that is slow and contemplative. <|endoftext|> Okay. How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am very good. Just looking for a movie that fits these parameters. Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Trying to ask questions but you are way ahead of yourself. Since you want to get right into it and keep asking questions about movies instead of socialize. What movies have you watched recently? <|endoftext|> Sorry boss. Just excited to hear what you have to recommend -- that's why we're here after all. The most recent film I watched was 1917. I quite liked it. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any other Steven King movies? <|endoftext|> I love Shawshank Redemption. <|endoftext|> That's always a classic. Have you watched The Shining? <|endoftext|> I have not. I'm familiar with the QUOTATION_MARKhere's JohnnyQUOTATION_MARK meme though. <|endoftext|> Well, I'd definitely recommend it as the new Doctor Sleep film that's just come out is a sequel and expecting to be amazing. <|endoftext|> Oh, I didn't know that! I'll have to check it out. <|endoftext|> Definitely suggest it. Do you have any favorite series or producer otherwise? <|endoftext|> Iain Smith is a favorite producer of mine. <|endoftext|> Ah, a good choice! Did you see Mad Max Fury Road? <|endoftext|> Oh yeah. What a blast. <|endoftext|> Awesome. For something with more thought and a different story, have you ever seen Touch? <|endoftext|> I haven't even heard of it. What's it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a deaf woman who experiences a home invasion <|endoftext|> Oh, that sounds riveting. <|endoftext|> It was very different from the norm. Another different option could be The Arrival, about humanity learning an alien language <|endoftext|> I love Arrival! One of my favorite films of all time. I usually have to set aside enough time to watch it twice. <|endoftext|> It's such a thinker. Want to check out the trailer and remember how much you love it? <|endoftext|> Sounds great! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> I believe I am supposed to be recommending a movie to you. So, do you like movies very much? <|endoftext|> Yes, I dont have a particular genre in mind <|endoftext|> Well that's good. If you had to choose between a horror movie and a comedy movie, which way would you go? <|endoftext|> Comedy sounds good for now. <|endoftext|> Okay, and what was the latest movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> Not really funny, actually one of the saddest movies ive seen, American History X <|endoftext|> Hah, yes fair, not really a funny movie at all. Do you have any actors or actresses that you liked in that movie. Also are there any genres that you hate? <|endoftext|> I'm not very picky about that. Anything with a good plot, but i guess in comedy I like goofy seth-rogan type movies <|endoftext|> Alright. Last question, would you prefer something more recent or something older? <|endoftext|> Recent for sure but no problem if you have an older one in mind <|endoftext|> Alright, I would recommend the movie Long Shot <|endoftext|> Whats it about? <|endoftext|> Its a kind of funny romantic comedy about a Journalist trying to get a date with his childhood crush. Except now his crush is running  for president. <|endoftext|> That sounds good. I'll try that. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Have a good day <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|> Oh, apparently we have to finished 10 turns of chatting. <|endoftext|> Yea Queue up that title for the trailer, do you have any other suggestions? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I enjoy comedy movies <|endoftext|> So anything you've seen in the past that you really like? <|endoftext|> I enjoy movies with Kate McKinnon <|endoftext|> Ok I really like her on SNL <|endoftext|> Yes, she is very clever and funny <|endoftext|> I know she has a part in Bombshell but I haven't seen it yet <|endoftext|> Ooh yes, that is one that I need to see as well <|endoftext|> Bombshell would be my recommendation then <|endoftext|> I will have to check it out <|endoftext|> It sounds like a winner I know Charilize Theron was nominated for an Oscar, and I really like her. <|endoftext|> Oh yes, there are a couple of movies I still need to watch that were nominated in the Oscars <|endoftext|> Ah me too I did see 1917 while good not sure about all the hype. <|endoftext|> 1917 was a good movie, I enjoyed the way it seemed to be filmed in one shot. <|endoftext|> Until you said that I guess I never really thought about it but it really was a one perspective shot. <|endoftext|> Yeah, my friend pointed it out to me before watching. It was interesting. <|endoftext|> Ok I'll take back my other comment since that really changes how I think of that movie. <|endoftext|> Haha, I would agree that it was slightly over hyped though <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the bomshell movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I would like to. <|endoftext|> Ok trying to get that up for you <|endoftext|> Perfect, thank you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello how are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing quite well, how about yourself? <|endoftext|> i am doing well thank you <|endoftext|> I hear you're gonna recommend me a movie? <|endoftext|> i will try my best <|endoftext|> I believe in you! <|endoftext|> what was the last movie you saw that you really liked? <|endoftext|> Oooh! great question.

What's that one about? <|endoftext|> an actress wants to make an independent movie and the story of how she make it happen <|endoftext|> that sounds really good. Is it set in Cannes? <|endoftext|> yes it is <|endoftext|> that sounds like something I'd be interested in! What genre is it? <|endoftext|> it is an indie comedy <|endoftext|> sounds great! I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> fine thank you, you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. hey so, what's a movie you have seen recently? <|endoftext|> I saw once upon a time in Hollywood <|endoftext|> That sounds like a really good movie. I want to see that. Do you have a favorite genre of movie? <|endoftext|> yeah I love action and adventure movies, you? <|endoftext|> Those are great movies. I also like comedy, family, and horror movies myself. <|endoftext|> comedy is good, although I don't enjoy horror much. <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Intern? It's one of my favorite movies <|endoftext|> nope what movie do you recommend I see next? <|endoftext|> Honestly, if you haven't seen it I would watch the internship. It stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. <|endoftext|> sounds awesome I'll check it out <|endoftext|> It is a great movie. Two salesman whose careers went down the toilet take an intership at google when they know nothing about tech stuff. It's a fantastic movie. <|endoftext|> it is comedy I presume? <|endoftext|> Yes it is. <|endoftext|> any other recommendation? <|endoftext|> Yes. I also like <|endoftext|> like what? <|endoftext|> Sorry, I also like now you see me.

Working on that now. <|endoftext|> Do you know who the main actress is? <|endoftext|> The main actors of the film are Lupita Nyong'o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker. What other questions do you have regarding this movie? <|endoftext|> Does Jordan Peele himself appear in the movie? <|endoftext|> To the best of my knowledge, he does not. He does however appear in the director's and writer's credits. <|endoftext|> Okay, what is the rating of the movie? <|endoftext|> IMDB rates this movie as a 6.9/10 with over 160,000 reviews. But Rotten Tomatoes rates the movie 93% fresh! <|endoftext|> oh wow that is really good.

Obviously, I like female protagonists too. <|endoftext|> I love dramas as well! Juno is a great movie, very funny!! I am going to find you the perfect movie! <|endoftext|> Wonderful. Thank you very much. <|endoftext|> I have the perfect movie in mind! I hope you havnt seen it yet!! <|endoftext|> What is it?! <|endoftext|> Shutter Island with Leonardo DiCaprio! Its the perfect twist of psychological and drama, with a surprise ending! <|endoftext|> I dunno ... that doesn't sound like it's within my preferred genre. What else you got? <|endoftext|> okay, no worries! I will find something for you! Do you like drama-thrillers, or do you prefer just drama? <|endoftext|> I prefer straight drama, but also well-crafted science fiction, like Alien and Aliens. <|endoftext|> Okay, let me see it this one sounds interesting to you! The first drama, sci fi that comes to mind Is QUOTATION_MARKThe Butterfly EffectQUOTATION_MARK, it came out in 204, with Aston Kutcher. Its about a man who suffers blackouts during significant events of his life. As he grows up, he finds a way to remember these lost memories and a supernatural way to alter his life by reading his journal.. <|endoftext|> I've seen that movie a long time ago, but I've forgotten a lot about the plot. I do remember that I liked it. Any other science fiction movies that you can recommend with a female lead? <|endoftext|> I really love Avatar and The Hunger Games, but those are newer so you have probably seen them. Edge of Tomorrow is a really good one, it has Emily Blunt as a head female character with Tom Cruise. Its about a soldier fighting aliens who gets to relive the same day over and over again, the day restarting every time he dies <|endoftext|> I've never seen Edge of Tomorrow -- that one sounds compelling. I'll check it out! <|endoftext|> Perfect, I hope you like it! Have a great day!! <|endoftext|> One more thing: if I like Juno, are there any movies pretty close to it? <|endoftext|> A few that remind me of Juno are QUOTATION_MARKwhip itQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKlittle miss sunshineQUOTATION_MARK !! <|endoftext|> Who is in QUOTATION_MARKWhip ItQUOTATION_MARK? What actors? <|endoftext|> Drew Barrymore, Ellen Page <|endoftext|> Okay, I'll look into it. Thanks so much -- have a great day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you pick a movie to watch! What kind of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> I do enjoy watching action films. <|endoftext|> what is the last action film you watched? <|endoftext|> I have watched many good action films over the years but my favorite was James Bond Quantum of Solace. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the newest Mission Impossible movie? <|endoftext|> No. I haven't. What is that movie about? <|endoftext|> Its about a group of spies who travel the world to solve missions, it's one of a series of movies starring Tom Cruise. <|endoftext|> That sounds good but was is the latest movie called in the series? <|endoftext|> Mission Impossible: Fallout. <|endoftext|> When did this movie came out? <|endoftext|> It came out in 2018 <|endoftext|> Thanks. Can you tell me briefly what Mission Impossible: Fallout is about? <|endoftext|> They join forces with the CIA to prevent a disaster. Terrorists are attempting to use plutonium to attack the vatican. <|endoftext|> It has a good plot. Who is starring in this movie? <|endoftext|> Tom Cruise and Angela Bassett <|endoftext|> Tom Cruise is one of my favorite actors of all time. <|endoftext|> His other Mission impossible films are pretty good too. I recommend starting from the first one. <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> I'm glad! You will have a great evening watching these movies! <|endoftext|> Thank you so much!!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hello how are you, I am looking for movie trailer recommendations? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well and you? What was the last movie you watched and how did you like it? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was Avengers Endgame, I liked it a lot especially the climax at the end <|endoftext|> Good choice! And how did you like Chris Evans in his role as Captain America? <|endoftext|> I though Chris did well as a poster child for the all american hero displaying both courage and a moral compass that guides him. I was glad to see he got to wield Thor's hammer. <|endoftext|> I agree I thought that part of the movie was exciting. I wish he would have been able to defeat Thanos with Thor's hammer. What movie genres peek your interest? <|endoftext|> It was a nice combination to give Captain America a more offensive capability vs the very defensive shield. A movie genre that would peak my interest would be horror also. <|endoftext|> Do prefer horror movies with drama or suspense? <|endoftext|> suspense would be preferred? <|endoftext|> Ok, based on your feedback I would highly recommend watching QUOTATION_MARKKnives OutQUOTATION_MARK. Chris Evans plays one of the leading roles. The movie is a Crime, Mystery, Thriller loaded with suspense. It's certified 'Fresh' on rotten tomatoes with a score of 96%. Are you interested? <|endoftext|> Yes I am interested in it now, I like the score? <|endoftext|> Great, I'm glad you're interested I'll send you the trailer now. <|endoftext|> Please send it to me so I may watch it <|endoftext|> Ok sending it now. <|endoftext|> Thank you I look forward to it arriving, I think it well be enjoyable <|endoftext|> You are welcome! <|endoftext|> I think Chris Evans will be a good actor in this recommended movie, it will be different from seeing him as Captain America <|endoftext|> Yes it's different but he's a versatile actor. Also Daniel Craig has a leading role as well. He is best known for playing James Bond in the most recent 007 movies. <|endoftext|> Yes, but I believe the next Bond will be Daniel Craig s last as bond as he should be passing the torch off? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Hello, I am doing well. How about you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great. Happy Thanksgiving! Are you interested in watching a movie trailer today? <|endoftext|> Happy Thanksgiving to you too. Yes, I'm interested. <|endoftext|> Great, what kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Action Suspense of the thriller kind. <|endoftext|> Great. What was a recent movie you watched of that genre that you liked? <|endoftext|> It was an older movie. It was called Frailty. <|endoftext|> What did you like about that movie? <|endoftext|> It kept you guessing as to whether the person he said he was was really that character. Or did he do a switch. <|endoftext|> Awesome, that sounds really cool. Have you ever seen the movie Inception? I think you might like that, it has a lot of action and is suspensful, and you are trying to figure out what is going on most of hte time <|endoftext|> Yes, I did see that. In fact I had to see it twice to make sure I was thinking correctly about the movie. Did you see that one? <|endoftext|> Yes I did, I really liked it. What about the movie Snowpiercer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I also saw that one and liked it as well. <|endoftext|> Cool. Seems like we have similar tastes in movies! Have you seen the trailer for Jojo Rabbit? <|endoftext|> It does sound like it. No, I haven't seen that trailer for that movie. <|endoftext|> Great! Its definitely suspensful, I saw it the other date. Would you like to watch it? <|endoftext|> Yes I would! <|endoftext|> Perfect, I think you will really like it. Its an intersting story and takes place in the past, but is very unique <|endoftext|> Ok, and I bet the name doesn't fit the movie. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> he i am here to help you with movie recomendations <|endoftext|> Great! I need a good movie to watch! <|endoftext|> what is your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> comedy <|endoftext|> i like action films have you seen the newest transformer, it has lots of mature comedy in it <|endoftext|> I wasn't a fan of the transformer movies. I saw the first one. I watched it as a kid way back when and the live action version is not my thing <|endoftext|> whats your favorite movie right now maybe we can spark some ideas from there <|endoftext|> While it is not a comedy movie, I like classic sports movies as well. The natural and field of dreams are tied for 1st. <|endoftext|> im a big fan of invincible and the longest yard these have strong motivations that drive the plot <|endoftext|> Those are great movies! <|endoftext|> what about friday night lights have you seen this one <|endoftext|> I accept that recommendation. I have not seen that movie. <|endoftext|> cool i think you will like it <|endoftext|> I look forward to it! <|endoftext|> do we have to keep chatting to finish' <|endoftext|> until we hit 10 turns yes <|endoftext|> ok well lets inprovise <|endoftext|> sounds good to me <|endoftext|> good you are a great person <|endoftext|> thank you, you too <|endoftext|> oh yea thank you, you have excellent movie taste! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing pretty well! How are you? <|endoftext|> Great. Are you a fan of any particular type of movie? I love a good story no matter what it is. <|endoftext|> I definitely have my genres I prefer watching, like comedy, rom-coms or dramas. Not a big thriller or horror movie person! I'll watch them, but I probably don't like it haha <|endoftext|> I stay away from horror movies no matter what. They make me jumpy! What was the last good movie you have seen? <|endoftext|> Honestly, I really like the Joker. Not a lot of people understood it and I feel like it was because they were expecting the Dark Knight Joker, rather than the real Joker himself. What about you? <|endoftext|> I have watched a lot of movies. Recently, my favorite was The Green Book. I thought it had such a good story of friendship. Do you like indie films at all? <|endoftext|> I do, but I haven't seen as many as I would l like! Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Hmmm. Have you seen Last Christmas? I think you would enjoy it as it is a Rom-Com. <|endoftext|> No I have not, and that's perfect for the Holidays! I will give Last Christmas a try :) Thank you! <|endoftext|> Last Christmas <|endoftext|> Last Christmas :) Thank you again <|endoftext|> Oh you may also enjoy Knives Out. It is a mystery and has a great cast. It also had great reviews. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> Awesome, I have been seeing trailers for it and it's caught my eye! <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of any old movies? <|endoftext|> Not particularly no. But I will take your two recommendations! <|endoftext|> Cary Grant always said his favorite movie was The Bishop's Wife. It is cute. What else do you like? <|endoftext|> I also have a soft-spot for musicals, they're sort of like my guilty pleasure haha! And of course, chick flicks. <|endoftext|> Try watching the Glen Miller Story the Five Pennies. They are oldies and goodies about musicians. Hope you like them! <|endoftext|> Sweet! I'll add those to the list. Any other recommendations? Just for fun <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm Adam. <|endoftext|> hi im Connie. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> i like to watch all different kinds, but action, thrillers, and suspense are my favorite. <|endoftext|> What was the latest thriller movie you watched? And what did you like and dislike from that movie? <|endoftext|> I like watching lifetime movies, but the last one i seen was the glass house: The Good Mother. <|endoftext|> Awesome! What did you like and dislike about the movie? <|endoftext|> its suspenseful about a mother that is evil and wants to harm the children she has there. <|endoftext|> Sounds like a good movie! Do you like psychological thrillers? <|endoftext|> i like all kinds of thrillers. they keep me on my feet. <|endoftext|> Great. I highly recommend the movie QUOTATION_MARKEscape RoomQUOTATION_MARK that was released this year. It is about six people from different backgrounds who are presented with a puzzle cube and when they solve the puzzle they are invited to go through an escape room. Whoever escapes first wins $10,000. This movie kept me on my toes the whole time I watched it. <|endoftext|> great, i have never seen escape room. I would definitely want to watch that. <|endoftext|> Great, I hope you enjoy it! I believe you may be able to stream it online now. <|endoftext|> if you can send the trailer that would be great. ok thank you. <|endoftext|> No problem! Have a good night. <|endoftext|> you too. thank you for the movie recommendation. <|endoftext|> No problem! Just a warning, some parts are quite scary if you are into that. <|endoftext|> that is what I like to watch. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello,how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> good thank you <|endoftext|> I am here to recommend a movie to you, if you're interested. <|endoftext|> that would be great I love movies <|endoftext|> What are some of your favorite genres? <|endoftext|> action,comedy and horror <|endoftext|> Which movies have you seen recently, that you really enjoyed? <|endoftext|> Avengers end game was great and Aquaman <|endoftext|> OK, I see. So you enjoy superhero movies? <|endoftext|> yes I love them <|endoftext|> Have you already seen the X-Men film Dark Phoenix? <|endoftext|> No i have not <|endoftext|> It looks like a good one. It stars Jennifer Lawrence and tells the story of Jean Grey as she further develops her powers. <|endoftext|> I will accept that sounds great <|endoftext|> As far as good comedy movies. I really liked the movie Boss Baby. <|endoftext|> I would like to see that as well <|endoftext|> What are some horror films that you really enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed Brightburn it was a new film from 2019 <|endoftext|> If you like Alien movies, you might enjoy the movie Area 51 <|endoftext|> ok sounds interesting I will check it out <|endoftext|> Which one is your favorite of my recommendation? Dark Phoenix, Boss Baby, or Area 51? <|endoftext|> Dark Phoenix is the one for me <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> Hi, I'm looking for sci-fi action movies <|endoftext|> Ok, one with lots of plot twists? <|endoftext|> Those are usually fun to watch, sure <|endoftext|> Do you want one with a particular actor or you don't mind which actor stars in the movie <|endoftext|> I don't mind the cast too much <|endoftext|> I think you might like Replicas <|endoftext|> Whats that about? <|endoftext|> It tells the story of a neuroscientist who violates the law and bioethics to bring his family members back to life after they die in a car accident. <|endoftext|> That sounds good. im interested. I'd watch that <|endoftext|> I'm sorry that is not available, can I recommend another please <|endoftext|> Yea, No problem <|endoftext|> Alita is also a good movie to see, I watched it twice. That's how interesting it is to see. <|endoftext|> Is that available? <|endoftext|> yes it is, it's really interesting <|endoftext|> Ill watch it! <|endoftext|> Okay that's great. Be sure to have popcorn and drinks <|endoftext|> Of course! thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> You are welcome. would you like to know few of the cast In Alita <|endoftext|> Yea sure! <|endoftext|> Rosa Salazar played Alita(The cyborg), Christoph Waltz -  The doctor who fixed her, Keenan Johnson - Hugo(Alitas buddy) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Hello, I like a variety of movies, recently have been watching The Mandalorian and a lot of martial arts movies from the 70s and 80s. <|endoftext|> Nice, so you're a fan well-choreographed combat? Any specific movies or shows besides The Mandalorian? <|endoftext|> Drunken Master and other Jackie Chan films are up my alley. Well-choreographed fighting is intriguing to me for sure. <|endoftext|> Drunken Master is great, he's got such a cool style of fighting. Are you into franchises or film series (if they're good), or are you more of a standalone film fan? <|endoftext|> I'm fine with either, Star Wars has a pretty good franchise although I can't say the recent movies are great, but I can take or leave franchises compared to standalone films. <|endoftext|> I totally get it, the franchises can often bring quality down. Have you by any chance seen John Wick? <|endoftext|> Yes I have, got the chance to see Chapter 2 and 3 in theatres, looking forward to the next iteration. <|endoftext|> Ok solid that's a great series. What about You Were Never Really Here? <|endoftext|> I haven't heard about that movie, what's it about? <|endoftext|> It's a pretty gritty action thriller starring Joaquin Phoenix, where he plays a former mercenary who deals with his trauma by taking down a human trafficking network and rescuing the girls they had captive. Would you be interested in watching the trailer? <|endoftext|> Sounds similar to Taken, but sure, I'll give it a go. <|endoftext|> It's better than Taken, much more intense and less by-the-numbers. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> You should also check out the Kingsmen series, first one was great and second one was kind of ok, but the third one looks much better. <|endoftext|> I've heard that, I only saw the first Kingsman and was more enamored by the clothes. <|endoftext|> Hahaha fair. Also Atomic Blonde with Charlize Theron is great action from the same creators as John Wick. <|endoftext|> I saw that one and was kind of disappointed, it's a lot more style than substance. <|endoftext|> Yeah they really turned it up for that movie. Last one that occurred to me, Old Boy (the original version) is a classic movie and it never gets old. <|endoftext|> Old Boy is incredible, Park Chan-wook's other films are neat as well. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> HI, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Im good. How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm very fine too, its nice to have you here. <|endoftext|> Thank you, my pleasure.

Can you tell me what it is about? <|endoftext|> Hereditary is a 2018 American supernatural psychological horror drama film written and directed by Ari Aster <|endoftext|> I am going to watch it, based on your recommendation. <|endoftext|> I recommend it, will you watch the movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, I will definitely watch it. <|endoftext|> Alright, good. <|endoftext|> Thank you for your recommendation. <|endoftext|> It was theatrically released in the United States on June 8, 2018. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello!

What type of comedy doesn't appeal to you? And have you seen Blockers? <|endoftext|> I like all types of comedy as long as it's not boring! I have no seen Blockers. Is it good? <|endoftext|> Yes! It is hilarious! About a group of friends to vow to lose their virginity on Prom night but their parents hear their plans and try and Block their efforts.. <|endoftext|> I accept your Blockers recommendation. I will watch this movie! <|endoftext|> Very Nice! <|endoftext|> As a matter of fact I think I'll watch it tonight. <|endoftext|> You are really going to enjoy it! <|endoftext|> I hope you're right. I'm excited. <|endoftext|> In fact it's so good I may have to watch it again myself! It's just a fun movie. <|endoftext|> Let's both watch Blockers tonight. <|endoftext|> Definitely! It's a plan! I could use a good laugh! Do you want to see the movie trailer for Blockers? <|endoftext|> Sure I'll watch the trailer for Blockers. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a plan, you will have to tell your friends about it if you really like it! <|endoftext|> If I like the movie I will definitely recommend it to my friends. <|endoftext|> That is awesome, I have told everyone about it :) <|endoftext|> Okay thank you again for the recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there, how are you? <|endoftext|> not bad and you? <|endoftext|> pretty good. Seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> not really, got any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Yeah actually, we went as a family to see the new Frozen, it was really good. I actually liked it better than the first one. <|endoftext|> really? better then the first? that is high praise indeed. I've not seen it yet. <|endoftext|> It is worth it. Everyone I talked with has thought the same. <|endoftext|> nice, I will have to check that out some day. <|endoftext|> awesome. Do you have kids to take with you? <|endoftext|> yes cousins <|endoftext|> Perfect. If you had a choice what type of movie would you rather watch? <|endoftext|> interesting question, I'm curious to see the new Star Wars film. <|endoftext|> So like sci fi? <|endoftext|> yes for sure <|endoftext|> Awesome. Well enjoy the movies!! <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> Dont forget the popcorn! Great source of fiber! <|endoftext|> oh yes it will be a night out with friends <|endoftext|> Did you know there is only one movie theater change that serves vegan butter with the popcorn? <|endoftext|> hm interesting we need healthy theater food i agree <|endoftext|> totally. Well have a great time <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> What's a recent movie you've watched? <|endoftext|> Nothing good. I'm looking for something new to watch. <|endoftext|> Do you have a fav genre like action, or comedy <|endoftext|> Oh, I like comedys. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Zombieland? <|endoftext|> I have. I liked it. <|endoftext|> Zombieland 2 was even better if you haven't seen that one <|endoftext|> Yeah, I haven't seen it. It looks good. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would. Thanks! <|endoftext|> So in the 2 movie Zombie slayers Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock leave the confines of the White House to travel to Graceland in Memphis, Tenn. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I just need to see if it's on Netflix or Prime. <|endoftext|> Currently only the first movie is, Jexi is another great comedy with Siri taking over someone's daily life <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of that one. Is Jexi any good? <|endoftext|> Jexi is a movie about a person that's addicted to his cellphone. He has no friends and his love life is nonexistent. Forced to upgrade to a new phone, Phil soon learns that the latest model comes with Jexi -- an artificial intelligence life coach, virtual assistant and cheerleader. With its help, he begins to get a real life. But as he becomes less dependent on the phone, Jexi starts to morph into a tech nightmare that's determined to keep Phil all to itself. <|endoftext|> That doesn't sound like a comedy. <|endoftext|> Jexi is like QUOTATION_MARKHerQUOTATION_MARK replayed as a lightly satiric, casually foul-mouthed smart/dumb commercial comedy <|endoftext|> Well I will try to watch Jexi after I watch Zombieland 2 <|endoftext|> Adam Devine is the main character in the movie <|endoftext|> I never heard of him. I think I'm going to go watch Zombieland 2. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi@ <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> How <|endoftext|> I am looking for movie trailer recommendations and I hope I can get some idea's. <|endoftext|> Sorry yeah, accidentally hit enter there :D. I'd be happy to help you there! What was the last movie you really loved watching? <|endoftext|> I love drama and comedy mostly, I just watched the new A Star is Born and loved it so much! <|endoftext|> Comedy and Drama huh? How do you feel about Movies that sort of mix the two together? <|endoftext|> Oh, love it! One of my all time favorite movies is Shawshank Redemption, but comedy is great like in Murder Mystery. <|endoftext|> Then I think I have a recommendation for you! Once Upon a time in Hollywood is a newer film and it mixes the two together really well. It has Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in it too, which is a plus :D <|endoftext|> Woohoo :) It sounds good, both great actors! What is the theme of the movie? <|endoftext|> Period piece about the movie industry <|endoftext|> Oh, I see. So it has Drama and comedy? I haven't heard of this movie lol <|endoftext|> Yep, has both. Another movie by the same director that also has Brad Pitt in it is Inglourious Basterds. Another period piece, this one about WWII France. Same sort of movie. Quentin Tarantino is the director and he has a knack for covering serious stuff with a humorous edge. <|endoftext|> Oh, yes! I have seen that one and it was pretty good. I love Quentin Tarantino <|endoftext|> Yeah, he's got a specific style lol. Ever See Django Unchained? <|endoftext|> Yes! Great Film! I haven't seen Rocketman or Bohemian Rhapsody yet do you know if those are any good? <|endoftext|> Bohemian Rhapsody was Great! Rami Malek was excellent as Freddie and they did some really fun stuff. Don't want to spoil it.:) <|endoftext|> Oh, that movie is more in my train of thought about what I would like to watch, maybe I should watch it! <|endoftext|> I'd recommend it. <|endoftext|> Thank you so much! I accept your recommendation to watch a trailer of Bohemian Rhapsody, I am excited :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer or movie recommendation <|endoftext|> Great <|endoftext|> A really good movie is called Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. <|endoftext|> Yes, that sounds good. What is it about? <|endoftext|> A prison buddy movie where a new guy finds a friend. And the harsh realities of prison life. But an uplifting story as well. <|endoftext|> Wow, tell me more <|endoftext|> It's set in the past, not in today's modern world. And the prison was a tough system. Corrupt cops and all. <|endoftext|> Morgan Freeman is an excellent actor <|endoftext|> He is but equally brilliant is Tim Robbins but he has had less stand out roles career wise. This is one of Robbins best movies. Great performances by both. <|endoftext|> Is it scary <|endoftext|> Not at all. But not for kids. Some adult talk. But no blood and guts. <|endoftext|> What is it rated? <|endoftext|> R rated 1994 film <|endoftext|> Did it win any awards? <|endoftext|> Not sure off hand but a lot of fan praise. It's a movie that sticks with you after watching. <|endoftext|> How many times have you seen it? <|endoftext|> Over 5 and whenever it's on cable. <|endoftext|> I will accept your recommendation <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> I look forward to seeing it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, are you interested in finding a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes i am. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you watch? <|endoftext|> Action, suspense, comedies and dramas <|endoftext|> Is there a specific genre you're currently in the mood for? <|endoftext|> action and suspense <|endoftext|> Cool, what was the last action/suspense film that you watched? <|endoftext|> John Wick 3 and 21 Bridges <|endoftext|> Do you want something that is lighter on story and non stop action like John Wick 3, or something a little bit more balanced between action and plot? <|endoftext|> More balanced. I love plot twist, it keeps me on my feet when watching the movie <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the Mission Impossible films? <|endoftext|> Yes. I've seen the first film. <|endoftext|> I recommend you check out Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. It's a great action thriller and if nothing else, Tom Cruise has always been dedicated to his craft. Would you like to see the trailer for Mission Impossible Rogue Nation? <|endoftext|> Yes i would love to see that trailer. <|endoftext|> Great! I really think you'll enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Alright thanks for the recommendation. I think Tom Cruise is a great actor and I can't wait to watch the film. <|endoftext|> I like Tom Cruise too, movie stars a dying and he is one of a kind these days. Anyway, the trailer will be on the way in just a minute...thank you for your patience! <|endoftext|> Great and you're welcome. <|endoftext|> That'll do it, have a nice day. The trailer will be sent momentarily. Bye! <|endoftext|> Thank you again and have a great day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hey, how's it going? Ready to chat movies? <|endoftext|> Yes! What kind of movies do you generally watch? <|endoftext|> I tend to watch old and experimental stuff, like Memento <|endoftext|> Do you like to go to a movie theater or do you usually watch at home? <|endoftext|> Normally at home <|endoftext|> What did you like about Memento? <|endoftext|> It was a very interesting film, it had one big concept that everything was devoted to <|endoftext|> True, I enjoyed it as well. Is there any topics you like more than others? For example, do you like a love storyline along with the main storyline? <|endoftext|> I tend to like Action films, but Romance and Foreign tend to work alright for me, genre wise <|endoftext|> Do you have a favorite action movie actot? <|endoftext|> Tom Cruise <|endoftext|> Did you see him in Jack Reacher? <|endoftext|> No, I wish I did! I liked him in Mission Impossible, like most other people <|endoftext|> That is a good one and one of his more recent movies. It was made in 2016, so not too old. <|endoftext|> I don't really know of many other action movies I like. I guess Inception, that shares a director too <|endoftext|> Source Code is a mind blowing movie like Inception in a way. A man wakes up in the wrong body and has to find a bomber of a train within 8 minutes <|endoftext|> That's a good movie. I'd accept that recommendation <|endoftext|> Awesome! Thank you! <|endoftext|> Can you recommend another movie like Source Code? <|endoftext|> Have you seen the Machinist with Christian Bale? It is older, but super interesting. <|endoftext|> Yep. That's a good recommendation. Bye! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Looking for a movie? <|endoftext|> Tell me something that has to with Marvel <|endoftext|> Sure, Do you have a favorite superhero? There are a lot of Marvel movies. <|endoftext|> What about anyone relative to the New Mutants universe <|endoftext|> So you are interested in the New Mutants trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, whenever the release can just nearly drop. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I feel like the release is so far away. This is supposedly going to wrap up the franchise. Any particular mutant your favorite? <|endoftext|> I like Apachee I am hoping in Gift-New Mutants cross over. <|endoftext|> Was that Thunderbird's brother. Seems vaguely familiar? <|endoftext|> Yes, I will accept the reccemnedation on that character profile. <|endoftext|> Good choice. I believe we have that trailer. Would you like to see it? <|endoftext|> Yes, but as it says will not be until 2020 <|endoftext|> I know. I got used to Marvel putting out so many so close together and now I have to wait. <|endoftext|> The next roll up of Marvel films I have no clue what titles there coming up with next. <|endoftext|> I am going to miss the classics. I loved Thor but could not get into Spiderman. <|endoftext|> I hear there is an another <|endoftext|> Really? I hadn't heard. That would be a must see. Know anything about the storyline? <|endoftext|> Thor the prequel comes back with an female main character. <|endoftext|> Sweet. Pretty cool. I will check that out. Well at least there is the New Mutants for now. <|endoftext|> I have to look up the details. <|endoftext|> So you definitely want to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> It is about that time for an QUOTATION_MARKDoneQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi , I am happy to recommend some movies for you today <|endoftext|> hello, i like actions movie <|endoftext|> Who are some of your favorite actors? <|endoftext|> will smith, samuel L jackson, irdis <|endoftext|> What was the last movie that you went to and liked? <|endoftext|> jumanj the next level <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy science fiction or superhero movies? <|endoftext|> yes i do , spiderman <|endoftext|> If you haven't seen Spiderman Far from Home , I would highly recommend it. <|endoftext|> no, I haven't I'll definitely watch it. <|endoftext|> I would also recommend Gemini Man, it stars Will Smith , is directed by Ang Lee and is a futuristic action film <|endoftext|> ok awesome (: this will be something I watch today in m y free time <|endoftext|> I sent you a trailer for Gemini Man . Have a great day <|endoftext|> thanks you too. <|endoftext|> I can recommend more movies if you would like <|endoftext|> sure i will like that. <|endoftext|> I really liked Ad Astra , if you like realistic science fiction , you will enjoy it <|endoftext|> sounds good,said i wanted to get into watching something different. <|endoftext|> Hope you enjoy the movies <|endoftext|> lol hope so too... <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> How are you today? <|endoftext|> hi, how are you? I love to hear about movies. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any trailers for movies coming out soon? If so, which ones are you interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> I have seen a trailer for the new movie that came out on February 14th. It was Sonic the Hedgehog. <|endoftext|> Was the movie any good? The trailer made it look amusing. <|endoftext|> It looked good and I am interesting in seeing this movie. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the trailer for the new James Bond movie? I always see the newest Bond films. <|endoftext|> I have not yet, but I am willing to consider seeing the James Bond film. <|endoftext|> From what I see, it looks like a logical continuation of the Spectre theme - it has the Bond girl form the last file as well as the newest Blofield. I think this will be great. <|endoftext|> hmmm that sounds good. that reminds me of the older james bond movie with sean connery- diamonds are forever. if you got the trailer, i would be willing to watch it. <|endoftext|> Diamonds are forever was a classic. I do, however, like the newer films more. Less cynicism and more plausible. What do you think? <|endoftext|> I agree. sometimes the remakes are just as good as the orginials. <|endoftext|> I am looking at the trailer for Casino Royale - a great reboot is ever there was one. <|endoftext|> great movie. i liked daniel craig playing poker in that movie. <|endoftext|> Yes - the Texas Hold'em scene was suspensful. <|endoftext|> agreed. and intense. anyway i do accept your recommendation for the new james bond film. <|endoftext|> Great! Let's watch that trailer. <|endoftext|> sounds good to me. <|endoftext|> I am booting it up now. <|endoftext|> ok, i will be waiting for it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> good how are you? <|endoftext|> i am good. do you want to talk about movies with me? <|endoftext|> ok sure <|endoftext|> what kind of movies do you enjoy watching? <|endoftext|> war movies <|endoftext|> like war of the worlds? <|endoftext|> no wat movies <|endoftext|> oh do you have any specific movies you enjoyed watching? <|endoftext|> Saving private ryan <|endoftext|> ok I might a movie for you if your interested. <|endoftext|> tell me <|endoftext|> Black Hawk Down <|endoftext|> ok thanks <|endoftext|> have you ever heard or seen this movie before? <|endoftext|> no I haven't <|endoftext|> ok, would you like me to recommend it for you? <|endoftext|> ok please <|endoftext|> just selected the movie.

Do you have any specifically in mind? <|endoftext|> What kind of  movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I typically like dramas or comedies. Horror films can be fine too but they are sometimes more hit and miss. <|endoftext|> Cool, those are great genres. <|endoftext|> Any recommendations for a good drama or comedy to watch? I've recently seen a lot of the Best Picture nominees but am looking for something else to watch. <|endoftext|> If your looking for a good comedy you can not go wrong with the new Will Smith and Martin Lawerence movie BAD BOYS for Life. <|endoftext|> I've wondered about that. That's one I've hesitated to see so far, not being sure about how good it was. Any sort of drama/action movie? <|endoftext|> Bad Boys for life is the third installment to the very successful Bad Boys franchise. If your looking for another drama/action movie you might check out the next installment of the James Bond franchise with Daniel Craig in No Time to Die. <|endoftext|> I've been eyeing that one before it comes out. Do you know if it's getting good reviews before it comes out? <|endoftext|> I have not heard of any reviews on it yet due to not being released, however it is trending up on the popularity charts on IMDB <|endoftext|> Awesome. I'll take your recommendation on that and check out more. Sometimes I avoid trailers but I'll check that one out. I kind of forgot it was coming out soon. <|endoftext|> Awesome, have you seen some of the other bond movies? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I've seen several of the recent ones. I haven't seen them all going back but saw Skyfall and Spectre for sure. So I'll make sure I check out this trailer. <|endoftext|> Cool, enjoy! <|endoftext|> I guess one more thing ... Since that's not out for a bit any chance you have a trailer for a movie that I could see today? <|endoftext|> Sure! Have you seen the movie Midway, based on actual events that is said to be the turning point of the war in the pacific during WW2? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that. Not sure I've heard much about it. So is it a dramatized version of those events? <|endoftext|> It's an action movie of the event. It's said to be close representation of what occured. <|endoftext|> Nice. I saw 1917 and liked that, so this might be in my wheelhouse. Is that in theaters now or somewhere to rent? <|endoftext|> It recently was released onto Digital/Blu Ray <|endoftext|> Perfect. I'll take your recommendation on that one and check out the trailer to see if I like it ... And of course I'll check out the Bond one too! <|endoftext|> Awesome, have a great Day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hey how are you doing tonight <|endoftext|> Honestly very bored. Yourself? <|endoftext|> same haha, so what type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Epic fantasy, historical.... Like Harry Potter, Star Wars and Game of Thrones types. <|endoftext|> i think the last harry potter-esq movie was crimes of grisenwald and i thought that was pretty good. I'm sure you have the same opinon about GOT S8 right? haha Did you get a chance to see the rise of skywalker? <|endoftext|> I've seen every one of them. I'm disappointed with how Skywalker ended. I mean... they're pretty much all dead! I've seen and liked both Fantastic Beasts, waiting for the 3rd. And to hell with whoever decided to kill Daenerys! lol <|endoftext|> Yea I wasn't a huge fan of the Star Wars ending... and I think Martin originally had the idea to kill Daenerys, but the HBO writers really messed it up. I'm also pretty excited for the next Fantastic Beasts series. Have you checked out the kid who would be king? <|endoftext|> Yes, it was cute. Was more for my kids though. It could have had.... more to it. Know of any good ones that are streaming? Like say Netflix for example? <|endoftext|> right, i was going to say some other ones, but didn't send it. i think some more darker ones that are on netflix that i really enjoyed was Pan's Labyrinth. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> Actually, no. I remember wanting to see it but never did. Remind me what it's about? <|endoftext|> i saw it a while ago, but i remember it had some pretty dark scenes and a girl who goes into a different fantasy world. It's by Guillermo del Toro so it has kind of that similar Hellboy-esq creatures but I liked this a lot better than Hellboy <|endoftext|> Oooh that reminds me I need to watch the new Hellboy also. Have you seen it? And I love del Toro's work! <|endoftext|> i haven't seen the new Hellboy, but I probably will at some point =) So shall we go for the trailer of the new Hellboy or Pan's Labyrinth? <|endoftext|> I think we can go for both. lol Thank you. <|endoftext|> seems like they don't have a trailer for Pan's Labyrinth.. lol lets try hellboy <|endoftext|> Yes... I've just seen the trailer. I think I'm going to stop doing tasks and watch the movie now before sleep. <|endoftext|> ah ok, are you going to try to finish this one? <|endoftext|> Of course. And thank you for the chat. <|endoftext|> sure i think i have to click the QUOTATION_MARKdoneQUOTATION_MARK button so i will in the next window <|endoftext|> Have a great night. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Hi I'm doing good. How about you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing great thanks for asking <|endoftext|> Have you seen any movies lately? <|endoftext|> I recent saw the invisible man. It was pretty good. What are you favorite types of movies? <|endoftext|> Well I like James Bond and John Wick movies <|endoftext|> Good choices! So you like a lot of action movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I just recently got into John Wick <|endoftext|> I havent seen the 3rd one yet. But I loved John Wick 1 and 2 <|endoftext|> Same here I just finished the second one a few hours ago. <|endoftext|> Did you like the first or second one better? I liked them both, but I think the first was a bit better <|endoftext|> Yeah I would agree, the first one seemed to have more action in it. <|endoftext|> Who are some of your favorite actors or actresses? <|endoftext|> I like Dywane Johnson. But I really don't have a favorite. <|endoftext|> Yeah he's pretty cool. He's in a new movie coming out in a couple of months. Jungle Cruise, it looks pretty good. Have you seen the trailer for it? <|endoftext|> You know I don't think I have. <|endoftext|> He plays a boat captain, taking a group of explorers to find some lost tomb in south america. It takes place in the early 1900s. It looks like a mix of Jumanji and Pirates of the Caribbean. A lot of action and adventure. Does that sound like something you would like to see? <|endoftext|> Yeah I would look at the trailer and see how it is. I liked Jumanji so I probably would like Jungle Cruise. <|endoftext|> Yeah it looks really good. I will recommend that movie for you then. Sound good? <|endoftext|> Yes it does <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> IM doing good looking for a recommendation for a family friendly movie <|endoftext|> Do you like animated movies? <|endoftext|> i love animated movies <|endoftext|> I recently got the Disney+ membership and watched a bunch of movies this last month, it had such a great selection! <|endoftext|> What are some of your favorite movies on Disney+? We love legos <|endoftext|> My favorite one that I had not seen and was very happy to have stumbled upon was Inside Out a Pixar Film <|endoftext|> I've never heard of it does it have a good storyline? <|endoftext|> Oh yes, it's a very endearing tale about the 4 main emotions that we all go through and the things that trigger those emotions and feelings. Made me cry for sure! <|endoftext|> I think that sounds like a great movie to watch tonight <|endoftext|> I think you will love it. Had me on the roller coaster of emotions but it wasn't overly sad or dramatic. Just right in my opinion.:) <|endoftext|> How long was the movie? <|endoftext|> I want to say about an hour and 20 minutes or so <|endoftext|> Does it have animals in it or is it about people? <|endoftext|> Not really animals, they are people that look like their emotions. I think there are some animals when they adventure through the brain. <|endoftext|> Is it adults or kids emotions? <|endoftext|> The focus is on the young girl, but adults will certainly relate if they can remember being a kid.:) <|endoftext|> that does sound like a great movie. Anything else i should no about it? <|endoftext|> Have your snacks and drinks ready so you don't have to miss anything, and don't forget the tissues of you tend to cry....it might cause a few to fall! <|endoftext|> I definitely will i am 100% thats the movie ill watch <|endoftext|> Awesome! Have a great night watching it. There is a cool Pixar Short for it as well, you can probably find it in the extras. Very cute scenario in the park with actors switching as the people change the emotions. I gotta go now, but I hope that you enjoy the flick! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you? <|endoftext|> Hello. I'm doing great how are you? <|endoftext|> Good! Thanks! What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds of movies but my favorites are action and comedies <|endoftext|> Have you heard about the new Zombieland movie? It sounds like it would fit you perfectly! It's a comedy and action film. <|endoftext|> Yeah I remember seeing trailers for it back when it was released. I don't know why I never went to see it <|endoftext|> You should check it out! It's available on Youtube, Google Play, Prime Video, and Vudu for less the $5! <|endoftext|> Are there any other movies that blend comedy and action like Zombieland? <|endoftext|> My favorite action/comedy movies are the DeadPool series! You should check those out! <|endoftext|> Yeah I loved the first one. I haven't seen part 2 yet though. Is it as good as the first one? <|endoftext|> I loved it! All of my friends did too! It's just as good, if not better! <|endoftext|> Awesome I think I will check that one out too. <|endoftext|> Great! Hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Do you know of any good horror movies? <|endoftext|> You should check out the nun! I loved that movie! <|endoftext|> Is it really scary? I want a really scary movie <|endoftext|> I thought it was, it took place it a very tattered and ruined palace in Romania. <|endoftext|> Oh nice <|endoftext|> The special effects with the characters is amazing too! <|endoftext|> That sounds awesome. Is it on Netflix? <|endoftext|> Unfortunately it's not, but it is on Hulu for free! <|endoftext|> Thank you so much for your help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Hi! I'm doing great! <|endoftext|> I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. What kind of movies interest you? <|endoftext|> I like many genres such as horror/triller, romantic comedies and historical/based on a true story <|endoftext|> What is the last movie you watched and truly enjoyed? <|endoftext|> The last movies i saw at the movies and enjoyed or streamed online?? <|endoftext|> in the movie theater <|endoftext|> Okay the last movies I really enjoyed that I saw at the movie theater was Richard Jewel <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the Star Wars Movies in the theater? <|endoftext|> The only one I have seen at the movies was Solo with my brother <|endoftext|> Have you seen the trailer for Sully? <|endoftext|> I have not. What is that movie about? <|endoftext|> It is about Captain Chesley Sullenberger trying to make an emergency langding in the New York's Hudson River after it hits geese and has the potential to crash. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a movie it enjoy watching! I accept your recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> Awesome! It was great to speak with you today! Enjoy! <|endoftext|> You where really engaged as well! I enjoyed this conversation <|endoftext|> I did as well. <|endoftext|> Have a good remainder of the day. I will be streaming Sully tonight thanks to you <|endoftext|> You as well. That is wonderful. Enjoy. <|endoftext|> Thank you! I will <|endoftext|> Have a great time streaming. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes I have! <|endoftext|> What have you seen? <|endoftext|> I just saw Sonic last weekend, it was really a cute move <|endoftext|> That's a great one that I think my kids would like. Do you enjoy those kinds of movies <|endoftext|> I do, I am dying to go see the invisible man! I am not normally a fan of scary movies, but that looks good to me <|endoftext|> That's based on Twilight Zone episode! I would totally recommend it. <|endoftext|> I have never heard of Twilight Zone, but normally action or romance, and of course with kids I see mostly kids movies <|endoftext|> Twilight Zone is an old black/white tv series, they usually play episodes around New Year. I enjoy more romance movies myself <|endoftext|> Hmm, I will have to look into that,  I think Dirty Dancing is my all time favorite <|endoftext|> I love Dirty Dancing too. Don't leave baby in a corner <|endoftext|> Never! So you think I should try Invisible Man? <|endoftext|> Sure why not, looks interesting to me too. But maybe check out the Dirty Dancing remake? <|endoftext|> Maybe, I wonder if you can actually re-make a classic like that. Will it be the same without Patrick??!! <|endoftext|> Probably wont be as good, the remake is never AS good. But could provide some entertainment <|endoftext|> That is what movies are all about, entertainment. If I am not entertained I will fall asleep. I think I will try the new Dirty Dancing and see what I think. I do like comparing movies against one another when they are remakes or movies made from books <|endoftext|> HA me too! I think the books is always better though. Nothing like seeing things with your own imagination <|endoftext|> I agree, I love reading and have yet to see a movie that I liked better than the book. <|endoftext|> There are a few that came close for me but I'd rather the book <|endoftext|> A Dirty Dancing book would be great! <|endoftext|> Yes! Patrick would be the lead <|endoftext|> Yes it would! Thanks for the recommendation, I am going to try the Dirty Dancing movie first! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello there! I am here to help you find a movie trailer. what is your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Hey, my favorite genre is Rom Com. <|endoftext|> oh that is great! mine too! what is the latest you have seen? i recently watched The Switch. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> No, and it doesn't sound familiar. <|endoftext|> Jennifer Aniston stars in that one next to Jason Bateman. Do you like them? would you be interested in me telling you a little about The Switch or is there a certain Rom-Com movie you already had an idea of. <|endoftext|> Oh okay, I know the movie switch. I didn't really like that one <|endoftext|> Okay not a problem. A more recent one that was released in 2019 with the always funny Rebel Wilson called QUOTATION_MARKIsn't it RomanticQUOTATION_MARK is like a female version of Shallow Hal starring Jack Black. have you already seen those. <|endoftext|> I've seen shallow hal but not this isn't it romantic. What else do you know about that <|endoftext|> So Rebel Wilson feels she is unworthy of love because of her weight and is super self conscious. she hits her head and when she awakes she has all this new confidence and puts herself out there. she realizes she is in a Rom-Com but thinks its a dream so she plays along. Gets to date a very handsome man. but learns more about herself at the same time. does that sound like something you might be interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> Yes! I would love that recommendation!!!! <|endoftext|> awesome while I get the link for the movie. let me just add this a great date night movie so dont forget the popcorn and candy ;-) <|endoftext|> Lol if my SO wasn't up north for work and liked Rom Coms <|endoftext|> thats a bummer for sure! this movie will for sure keep your spirit up with a great laugh <|endoftext|> Awesome, Do you have a trailer I could watch? <|endoftext|> I am searching the trailer right now there are a few with the same title. I want to make sure i get you the correct one. <|endoftext|> Okay Great! <|endoftext|> okay thank you so much for waiting with me! <|endoftext|> No problem, I understand how computers work lol <|endoftext|> lol yes i found it! again i hope you enjoy this have a wonderful day <|endoftext|> You too! Thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> Hi. I'm doing alright. It's been a relaxing weekend. How about you? <|endoftext|> It's quiet here. Going to watch some Netflix later. You see any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Nothing that really stands out right now. I've had a bit too much drama lately. Thinking back, I do have to say that I enjoy a good Psychological Thriller <|endoftext|> Me too. I saw El Camino recently. It was great! <|endoftext|> That was intense. I love Breaking Bad. I'm thinking something more like Silence of the Lambs or Along Came a Spider. Ever see anything like that? <|endoftext|> Got it. Yeah, I've seen Silence of the Lambs - it was eerie. Anthony Hopkins is soooo chilling in it. <|endoftext|> He's good <|endoftext|> Did you see the sequel? Hannibal. <|endoftext|> Sure did. I think there was another one after that, but I don't think I've seen it. <|endoftext|> Yes! Red Dragon. That was intense. <|endoftext|> I think I've seen it, but I don't remember at all. Maybe it's time to rewatch the whole series. What was Red Dragon about? <|endoftext|> It's about the guy that caught Hannibal the first time, Will Graham. He's play by Edward Norton. Years later, Graham is investigating another serial killer and goes to Hannibal for advice. Hannibal, of course, manipulates things for his own end. Ralph Fiennes is the serial killer, who is obsessed with this painting, The Red Dragon and thinks he is possessed by that dragon. <|endoftext|> I think that's a good choice. <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Do you think I should start back with Hannibal since I don't remember it well? <|endoftext|> I don't think the order matters. I'd go with Red Dragon first - I liked it more than Hannibal. <|endoftext|> While we're at it. Have you seen any good comedies lately? I have a feeling I'll need something to lighten up my mood afterwards :) <|endoftext|> Spider Man Into the Spider Verse was good - it was funny and exciting, and the animation was incredible. <|endoftext|> I've heard good things about that one. I think I'll start with Red Dragon and then check that out as well. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, I'm Janette <|endoftext|> Hi I'm Laura <|endoftext|> Have you seen Bohemian Rhapsody, the movie? <|endoftext|> No I have not, I am not familiar with that movie. <|endoftext|> No worries, what was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> I watched that movie with Adam Sandler, Uncut Gems. I thought it was going to be funny but it wan't funny at all. <|endoftext|> It seems like a serious movie. You seem like you like funny movies. What's the funniest movie you've seen? <|endoftext|> I think my all time favorite is Step Brothers <|endoftext|> Yes! That movie is hilarious! I have seen it about 10 times <|endoftext|> I probably have seen it 20 or 30 times! I think I like the first part better than the part when they start doing the Boats and **** song but I will say that has got to be one of my top 5 movies EVER <|endoftext|> Got It <|endoftext|> Are we done talking now?? I wouldn't mind watching that again now!!:) <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would <|endoftext|> Want to watch the trailer for Get Hard? It is a comedy with Will Ferrell <|endoftext|> Yes I think I have seen that one too. Funny <|endoftext|> Did you see it in theaters? <|endoftext|> No I saw it at home. I have the DVD <|endoftext|> Oh ok, I saw it in theaters. It had 2 nominations! <|endoftext|> One of my top movies as well.. <|endoftext|> A friend of mine was actually in the movie. <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation. I believe you accepted my as well. Nice speaking with you. <|endoftext|> It was nice speaking with you too! Yes, you will have a good laugh. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hello! Nice to meet you, I really like movies, all sorts of them in fact! How about you? <|endoftext|> Yes, I love movies. I am a fan of Victorian style movies. I am here to assist you with looking for a movie trailer. What is your favorite movie style? <|endoftext|> To be honest that's a hard question to answer, I like all sorts of movies. I am unfamiliar with the Victorian style, can you explain what that is a bit perhaps? I know I enjoy many action, thrillers, horror, comedy, drama, and suspense types. I am quite curious about maybe seeing a trailer for a favorite movie of yours in the victorian style as that would be new to me. <|endoftext|> Most of the victorian style movies have been developed from a writer of that era and have been made more than once. They tend to remake them between 10 and 20 years apart. The newest one to fall under this category would be EMMA. Gwyneth Paltrow played Emma in the last one. They are of English/England culture in nature between early and late 1800s. <|endoftext|> Oh I see, that sounds quite interesting I will search a trailer for that! Thank you for the suggestion. <|endoftext|> My pleasure. Oscar Wilde is a great writer of that era. Jane Eyre and The Little Women are also of that nature. Social issues and proper etiquette rule the show. The humor can be found in the expectation of proper etiquette yet, the rude manner it can be delivered. A great place to learn proper ways of socializing. <|endoftext|> I just watched a small trailer for the movie EMMA that you suggested, I can indeed see many of the elements you mentioned being in the movie. It looks like it would be a wonderful watch with a close friend of mine, i think we will put this on our to do list! I know we both would quite enjoy the humor in this show just from the brief trailer I saw. <|endoftext|> Great! Another movie is An Ideal Husband. This was a play written by Oscar Wilde turned into a movie. He is also the author of the play, QUOTATION_MARKThe Importance of Being <|endoftext|> Oh, I have not heard of either of those either. I will do some researching on An Ideal Husband as well.Being from the same writer I am certain I would be interested in seeing more of their work. <|endoftext|> The Importance of Being Earnest is the play I mentioned. This play can be watched on YOUTUBE. You will find it interesting as a form of a movie/play. <|endoftext|> I just watched a trailer for QUOTATION_MARKAn Ideal HusbandQUOTATION_MARK this looks like another good suggestion, also QUOTATION_MARKThe importance of being ErnestQUOTATION_MARK sounds very familiar, I know I have heard of that before, thank you for that suggestion too. <|endoftext|> You are welcome <|endoftext|> An Ideal Husband is from 1999, and has many familiar faces of actors I have seen in other films over the years. I am shocked I don't recall watching it, but it also seems a good watch with my friend I mentioned previously. I tend to do movie nights often with a close friend, and we are always looking for new things to watch, I know she would like these. <|endoftext|> Yes...I agree. The play on our social scenes versus early England society is wonderful. We are still the same except they hid their misdoings while we are more relaxed about shortcomings. <|endoftext|> I agree with you, it's nice to be able to find comedy in such things, nothing better than enjoying a nice laugh and a good story. Especially with loved ones! <|endoftext|> If you are ever curious what became of Oscar Wilde there is a 2018 movie, QUOTATION_MARKTHE HAPPY PRINCEQUOTATION_MARK that explains what became of him. Subsequently, explaining why we haven't heard from him after a certain period of time. <|endoftext|> That sounds quite interesting too, I will do some research on that now. That was another movie type I forgot to mention liking, autobiography I guess it would be called? telling the story of someones life works and such <|endoftext|> Yes...Oscar Wilde is an interesting character to learn about. Don't forget to have tea and pastries for your movie night. A good idea with a Victorian themed movie date. HAVE A WONDERFUL NIGHT....good night <|endoftext|> Thank you again for the wonderful suggestions, I researched QUOTATION_MARKThe Happy PrinceQUOTATION_MARK and will definitely look into watching that as well, and what a wonderful idea setting up some tea and pastries for movie night snacks, bravo! I accept your recommendations, you have a goodnight too. Thanks again! <|endoftext|> You are very WELCOME... <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> I am here to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> I can pick any movie I have in mind ? <|endoftext|> Yes, or I could help you find one you would like <|endoftext|> How about Sonic? <|endoftext|> Let me help you find one you mind be interested in. <|endoftext|> Well I'm interested in the movie Sonic <|endoftext|> Ok. What other types of movies are you interested in? <|endoftext|> well I like action, comedy but I love horror and mystery <|endoftext|> Me too. I really enjoyed Knifes Out which includes mystery. Would you like to see this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah actually I would. <|endoftext|> Ok great! It has many well-known actors in that film. Does that make you more interested in seeing it? <|endoftext|> I love Chris Evans in Captain America, so I like to see how good he plays this role <|endoftext|> He does a great job in this film as well! Are you interested in murder mysteries? <|endoftext|> I love mystery, I like to try to find out who's the killer, or who is going to survive <|endoftext|> That's why I enjoyed this film! It really has you questioning every character. <|endoftext|> Yes, I love to do my own analysis about the whole plot and to see whether  was correct or wrong <|endoftext|> Lets get you started with the movie trailer! <|endoftext|> sound good <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I'm great, thank you! I'm looking for a movie recommendation tonight, can you help? <|endoftext|> I would be happy to. Let me ask a few questions to choose a good one for you. What are your favorite types of movies? Like action, comedy, etc ? <|endoftext|> I really like adventure movies, with a lot of action. <|endoftext|> Ah ok, what was the last movie that you saw at the theater? <|endoftext|> The Rise of Skywalker <|endoftext|> Did you like it? <|endoftext|> It was okay <|endoftext|> Who are some of your favorite actors and actresses? <|endoftext|> Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Idris Elba <|endoftext|> Ok I think I found an upcoming movie you might like <|endoftext|> Cool, is it in the theaters now? <|endoftext|> It is coming soon, would you like one that is already in theaters? <|endoftext|> I would like one that I could watch at home if possible? <|endoftext|> Ok, I found one that has Daniel Craig, it got great reviews and it is available to watch at home <|endoftext|> Great, what is it? <|endoftext|> It is called Knives Out. It was released in 2019 and is listed as a crime, mystery, thriller, with a little bit of comedy <|endoftext|> I've actually already seen that movie. Do you have another recommendation? <|endoftext|> Did you like it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I loved it! <|endoftext|> I found one that is similar to Knives Out. I watched it the other night and really enjoyed it. It is called Ready or Not. <|endoftext|> Can you tell me more about it? <|endoftext|> Of course. A woman marries into a wealthy eccentric family. On her wedding night she has to play a game of hide and seek. The rest of the family is trying to kill her, and she has to stay hidden until dawn to win. It is more of thriller with a little bit of comedy. <|endoftext|> Is it really violent? <|endoftext|> No, not really. There are some deaths but nothing extreme <|endoftext|> I don't really think I want to watch that. I'd like more of an action movie than a thriller <|endoftext|> How about the new Jumanji Movie with the rock? <|endoftext|> Can I see it at home? <|endoftext|> Yes, it is available at home now. It is a comedy but also has a lot of action. <|endoftext|> Can you tell me more about it please? <|endoftext|> A team of friends return to Jumanji to rescue one of their own but discover that nothing is as they expect. The players need to brave parts unknown, from arid deserts to snowy mountains, in order to escape the world's most dangerous game. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a good choice! I like this recommendation and accept it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello? <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> how are you :) . what type of movie are interested in might i ask? <|endoftext|> I love action movies, dramas and horror movies the most <|endoftext|> have you seen 21 bridges?? <|endoftext|> No, I've never even heard of that, what is it about? <|endoftext|> lol long story short, its about a IA(internal affairs) who find out how the entire police force is corrupted. <|endoftext|> Oh, ok, so it's kind of a crime movie? <|endoftext|> you could say that. what is the last movie you have seen? <|endoftext|> I saw Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey in the theater with some friends last month, but I thought it was just OK <|endoftext|> . oh ok yea my wife wants to go and see that. last thought karate movies? <|endoftext|> I like karate movies but I don't watch them all that often.

And it's coming out very soon, March 13, 2020! <|endoftext|> Okay. So I can wait it in theaters. I will check out the trailer. It seems interesting. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good Morning! <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> So...what's your favorite type of movie to watch? <|endoftext|> My favorite type of movie is romantic comedies and I do love movies that make me cry at some point in the story ;-) <|endoftext|> I also like romantic comedies...especially the ones where I don't think I'll cry, but do anyway! What's the last movie that you watched? Would you like me to recommend a similar type of movie or a different type of movie genre? <|endoftext|> the last movie I watched was groundhog day. Which is a romantic comedy so you could recommend something like that. <|endoftext|> Sorry for the delay! I have a recent romantic comedy that was out in the theaters this past year...it's called QUOTATION_MARKYesterday.QUOTATION_MARK Is this one that you've seen? <|endoftext|> Oh yes I have seen Yesterday but I did really like it and I would be willing to watch again! So I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> Wow! I'm really impressed that you saw that movie; a lot of people that I know didn't see it. I did cry at some point in that movie. I thank you for accepting my recommendation! Too bad we don't probably live in the same area, since I'm always looking for a movie buddy! <|endoftext|> Yes it is not a very popular movie but I very much enjoyed it! I too am always looking for a movie buddy i hope you find one! <|endoftext|> Have a great day! <|endoftext|> Why do you think not many people have seen Yesterday? <|endoftext|> Good question. Maybe it wasn't advertised as widely as it should have been. The leading guy, who's adorable, probably isn't considered a QUOTATION_MARKbig box office draw,QUOTATION_MARK like Brad Pitt. It seemed to be more of an QUOTATION_MARKindependent little art-house type romantic comedy,QUOTATION_MARK if that makes sense. Now I want to re-watch it! Did the movie make you tear up? <|endoftext|> It totally made me tear up! I especially loved the part where he met the other people who also remembered the beatles songs. And when he went to meet john lennon! <|endoftext|> Ohhhh, yes. I just got chills! Shall I recommend another movie or do you feel comfortable with where we are in our conversation? <|endoftext|> You could recomend another movie but I am also comfortable where we are - up to you <|endoftext|> What about Notting Hill? <|endoftext|> Oh thats another great movie I don't think I've watched that for about 10 years! <|endoftext|> Please rewatch! I'm just a girl....standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her. :-)  Final movie, QUOTATION_MARKThe Big Sick.QUOTATION_MARK Have a wonderful weekend! <|endoftext|> Good quote and big sick is another good movie! have a good weekend! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> good  How are you <|endoftext|> Doing great! Any plans for the weekend? <|endoftext|> No just working. You? <|endoftext|> Resting, I'm thinking about watching some movies tomorrow <|endoftext|> what ones <|endoftext|> Mistery/criminal ones, do you have a favorite genre? <|endoftext|> I like horror and science fiction <|endoftext|> Nice! I recently watched Player Number One, it was a very entertaining sci fi movie, have you seen it? <|endoftext|> no I haven't last science fiction I watched was the new Godzilla <|endoftext|> That's a really good one. The name of the movie was actually Ready Player One, it's about a futuristic world where people live through Virtual Reality <|endoftext|> I have seen the previews but never seen it. How much longer should we chat I think we covered all the rules <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the trailer and watch it at some point? <|endoftext|> most likely <|endoftext|> This weekend? <|endoftext|> Yeah I get out of work at 4pm so it gets me plenty of time at night to do stuff <|endoftext|> Good, do you usually watch movies on the weekend? <|endoftext|> Just Netflex ones. I watched truth or dare last weekend <|endoftext|> Nice, I hope you enjoy the recommendation I made <|endoftext|> I think I will like it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> I see you may need some help looking for a movie trailer, what genre are you looking for? <|endoftext|> I like comedies. Something that has clever jokes, references and is relateable to things happening today <|endoftext|> Awesome, so something fairly recent, do you have a top 5 comedian list or do you just prefer anyone who is generally funny? <|endoftext|> a few actors i like are Kevin Hart, Seth Rogan, Amy Poehler, Andy Samberg, Tina Fey <|endoftext|> That's a pretty great list, what's the last good comedy you've seen from one of the comedians/actors you mentioned? <|endoftext|> hmm thats a good questions. Most recently I watched Ted, the movie with the talking teddy bear and Central Intelligence with the rock and Kevin Hart. Two really good movies! <|endoftext|> Those two movies are actually hilarious, Kevin Hart and the Rock are a match made in heaven on screen! Are you open to comedies catered to children but have humor for adults as well? <|endoftext|> Haha yes they are! Any time those are in a movie, its almost a must watch! I like most comedies. i dont mind a kids movie <|endoftext|> Of course immediately I think of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Kevin Hart & The Rock had me dying in that one, very unexpectedly! <|endoftext|> Really? I havent seen it yet, I need to make my way to the theathers to see it <|endoftext|> The one I'm talking about is the one from 2017, I do know there is the new one out I think it's called Jumanji: The Next Level, I'll be going to see that as soon as I get the chance <|endoftext|> Ohh jeez, i must have gotten them mixed up! I will be watching the Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle! Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> No problem, please enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> And hopefully we both can get to see the new one soon! <|endoftext|> Yes! I definately want to watch the Kevin Hart/ The rock one then see the new one <|endoftext|> Hope you've got some movie snacks as well, have a good night! <|endoftext|> I will get some sour candy and kick back to watch it. Have a good night as well! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey how is it going today? <|endoftext|> Good and you? <|endoftext|> pretty good, winding down after a long day at work with some Netflix some <|endoftext|> Cool, still waiting for new season of my shows on netflix <|endoftext|> what kind of shows do you usually like to watch? <|endoftext|> comedy or rom-com, you? <|endoftext|> yeah I'd say comedy action or sci-fi. I can't wait for the new season of Big Mouth <|endoftext|> heard of that but never watched it, what kinda show is it? <|endoftext|> basically like a raunchy cartoon where the characters are all middle school students experiencing puberty but ridden in a way that it's geared toward adults to be able to look back nostalgically. <|endoftext|> I do not like animations or cartoons. what other movie or show is really good? <|endoftext|> As far as a movie I really like QUOTATION_MARKWhy HimQUOTATION_MARK with James Franco and Bryan Cranston <|endoftext|> what's that about? <|endoftext|> basically a dad realizes his daughter's eccentric Silicon Valley millionaire boyfriend is about to propose and almost ruins their entire holiday vacation since the dad and the boyfriend really don't get along <|endoftext|> sounds interesting, I'll go watch that. <|endoftext|> hope you enjoy it. Definitely had me rolling <|endoftext|> any show ideas? <|endoftext|> you might like either Veep or Shameless if you don't watch either one already <|endoftext|> a lot of people have been talking about shameless, i guess watch that <|endoftext|> yeah it's a bit of a roller coaster. you start off rooting for some characters and by the end of a season you do a complete 180 <|endoftext|> looking forward to that <|endoftext|> I'm sure you'll enjoy that too <|endoftext|> cool thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello from across the miles <|endoftext|> hello! <|endoftext|> so I see you are looking for a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> thats correct! Can you help? <|endoftext|> Of Course ! I go to the theatre alot and see most of what Hollywood puts out there. What type of movie do you think you might like ? what genre if I may ask ?.. <|endoftext|> I typically like action movie! bUt ones that make you think, not just ones with a lot of explosions <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched ? either rented of went to the theatre. <|endoftext|> I just watched the movie QUOTATION_MARKoutbreakQUOTATION_MARK on netflix and that was pretty good but a movie I watched recently was QUOTATION_MARK21 BridgesQUOTATION_MARK and I really liked that <|endoftext|> Well I recently watched QUOTATION_MARKCall me by Your NameQUOTATION_MARK, and it was beautiful;  both emotionally stirring, and visually stunning. May I tell you a little about it ?. <|endoftext|> that doesnt really seem like its my style <|endoftext|> well theres the Kevin Costner movie, QUOTATION_MARKThree days to KillQUOTATION_MARK.. thats full of action, as he and his estranged daughter reconcile,, its quite thought provoking,, ;-) <|endoftext|> I have actually seen that one and I thought it was a little boring because it was more about killing time with his daughter. My favorite movie of all time is Jack Reacher <|endoftext|> what about the new QUOTATION_MARKThe Call of the Wild QUOTATION_MARK with Harrison Ford ? thats a great movie ! <|endoftext|> I think that looks interesting! Ill accept that recommendation! <|endoftext|> Great ! The  story follows Buck, a domestic dog who finds himself in the wilds of the Alaskan Yukon in the late 1800s. Based on the 1903 Jack London book of the same name, the movie stars Harrison Ford as Buck\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds owner, John Thornton. <|endoftext|> Sounds cool!! <|endoftext|> Can you watch the trailer ? Let me know your thoughts ? <|endoftext|> it looks really cool! I really want to see it. The CGI of the dog looks a little fake but otherwise the movie seems to have really cool scenary <|endoftext|> I watched it with my best friend, and we kept talking how we relate to the friendship of the main character and the dog . <|endoftext|> Yeah and I just recently got a dog so it will be a great movie to see <|endoftext|> Plus Harrison is such a great actor <|endoftext|> he really is! Such an epic voice <|endoftext|> well you said you like action pics , so you can't get more action than this ! <|endoftext|> Exactly I am really excited to see it! <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I already did watch the trailer <|endoftext|> Think about how awful it would be to get lost in the woods, with all that cold, snow and limited food.... <|endoftext|> doesnt seem that awful if you have a cute dog with you haha! <|endoftext|> call of the wild <|endoftext|> Great I accept that recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, Are you interested in Movies? <|endoftext|> yes i am! you are as well? <|endoftext|> I am! What are your favorite type of Movies? <|endoftext|> I like historical, and horror movies <|endoftext|> Ok. I do too! what was the latest movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched back to the future, part 2, yesterday <|endoftext|> Love that Movie. Michael J Fox is in it. <|endoftext|> He is! before he got ill. very good classic, although not a historical or horror movie. <|endoftext|> Right. Have you seen Harriet? <|endoftext|> I have not. what is it about? <|endoftext|> The tale of Harriet Tubman's escape from slavery. Very good Movie <|endoftext|> OH! i remember seeing an ad for that. I would be very interested in watching that. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer for this movie? <|endoftext|> I would, yes. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> I will be happy to provide the link to the trailer. <|endoftext|> please do <|endoftext|> Here is the trailer. <|endoftext|> alright, ready when you are <|endoftext|> Thank You. Sending now. <|endoftext|> After watching the trailer, i would definitely like to watch this movie. thank you very much for your recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Great! I really love all kinds of movies. My favorites are war movies based on true stories such as American Sniper, We Were Soldiers, or Hacksaw Ridge. I am not opposed to other genres. Other favorites include comedy or medical dramas. Not the biggest fan on Horror. <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie with similar stories or different ones? <|endoftext|> Good question. Let\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds do similar today.:) <|endoftext|> I was really impressed with the trailer for the movie 1917 which is in theaters now. Have you heard of this movie? <|endoftext|> I have not heard of this one. <|endoftext|> There are two well known actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth. Looks like they play really good roles in this movie. <|endoftext|> Sounds great. I will accept this recommendation! <|endoftext|> I too am a war movie fan, this movie is based on World War I. I would also enjoy this movie. Thank you for accepting my recommendation. <|endoftext|> Absolutely, thank you for paying attention to my details and picking a movie that seems fit! <|endoftext|> Interesting fact, this movie also received a Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture for Drama. <|endoftext|> That\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds great! Movies that have awards or have higher ratings are always give more of an incentive to watch. <|endoftext|> I agree, it is also more interesting if it is based on a true story. Shows the struggles that this generation could never image. <|endoftext|> That is why I love that genre as well! To see and watch something that has actually happened that at the same time seems so unreal! Mind blowing! <|endoftext|> Yes, the base of the movie is about two British privates that were given an impossible mission to deliver a message deep in enemy territory, these days they would just use phone or email. <|endoftext|> So interesting. Have you or are you planning on watching this movie? <|endoftext|> I don't have plans set in stone but I would like to watch it before it is no longer available in theater. I think war movies are best watched on a big screen with surround sound. <|endoftext|> Yes, agreed. Adds that extra flare for sure. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm wanting to invest in a sound bar for this very reason. I used to have one and they are great for movie watching! <|endoftext|> That's not a bad idea, a sound bar would be a great addition to a home theater system! <|endoftext|> and if you shop around you can sometimes find a good deal on them <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today? <|endoftext|> im great, how are you? <|endoftext|> Fantastic thanks for asking! Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. Do you have any recommendations for a good movie? <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds: action, romance, drama. <|endoftext|> Do you like ones that are still family friendly? <|endoftext|> Yes, I sure do <|endoftext|> How about ones that might take place in space? <|endoftext|> Yes, I think I would enjoy that as well. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Guardians of the Galaxy? <|endoftext|> I did see the first one, but I never seen the second one. <|endoftext|> The second one is great, it has everything you are into. Comedy, action, romance! <|endoftext|> That sounds good to me. I will have to check it out. <|endoftext|> Yes, I really enjoyed watching it and I think you will too! <|endoftext|> I think I will too. I really liked the first one, so I'm sure I will like the second one as well. <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of the marvel movies? <|endoftext|> I actually am. I think they are a lot of fun to watch. <|endoftext|> Thats great. Obviously some of the characters are in the Avengers movies, but this one is quite funny. <|endoftext|> Good, I need a good laugh. I can't wait to watch it now. <|endoftext|> Yes, well I hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> I'm happy to help you with your search to the right movie taller. What type of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> I love all kinds of movies, I'm not really into girly like QUOTATION_MARKchick flicksQUOTATION_MARK but my favorite genre is horror. <|endoftext|> Great! What was the last horror movie you have seen, at home or in theater? <|endoftext|> The most recent one I watched was QUOTATION_MARKThe Invisible ManQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Did you really enjoy the invisible Man? If so what was it that seemed to have you intrigued? <|endoftext|> It was really good! The story line wasn't your traditional horror flick. It was sort of predictable but it still had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The story flowed really well and it didn't have a lot of dull moments, which often happens in horror movies. <|endoftext|> Do u prefer horror movies that have a realistic plot, fictional plot, or doesn't matter? <|endoftext|> It doesn't really matter, I feel like it's always scarier though if it's based on a true story. <|endoftext|> I couldn't agree more. <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy horror movies, as well? <|endoftext|> I enjoy the true stories, I have my degree in criminal Justice so I enjoy learning about the cases and psychological aspect. As for horror in general, I'm more of a comedy person. <|endoftext|> Okay that's so interesting. What is your favorite movie, in that genre? <|endoftext|> That is a hard one. As a kid, hands down any Rush hour. But, now there are so many good ones. I just don't care to much for the remakes..  like American pie was cool, not the 2,4, or 6th one <|endoftext|> That's true, the remakes are usually never as good as the originals! <|endoftext|> I'm finding it difficult to decide on which one to recommend. I've narrowed it down to two <|endoftext|> Okay, go for it! <|endoftext|> Well the first, Maggie, isn't based on a true story (as previously discussed) but given our current events with the coronavirus, who's to say it couldn't happen? Lol. It stars some phenomenal and well known actors as well. <|endoftext|> This was a great recommendation! The plot goes really well with the current sitations! <|endoftext|> However, I am leaning towards the movie trailer for split. It has 8 awards and 19 nominations. The story line is sure to keep you in the edge of your seat. <|endoftext|> That is actually one of my favorites! Such an amazing story and plot twist at the end! <|endoftext|> I've personally never seen the entire movie. However, I read this book called Sybil many times I loved it so much and the plot to split reminded me so much of the book. Sybil was based off a true story with multi personalities. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm here this morning to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hello I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd like to see the movie trailer <|endoftext|> What kinds of movie trailers might you be interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> Do you like action movies <|endoftext|> I do, but I'm a big fan of horror movies. How about you? <|endoftext|> I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd like to see a horror movie trailer <|endoftext|> What was the last horror movie or horror movie trailer that you watched? <|endoftext|> Last horror movie let me think for a sec I have a few horror movies stuck in my mind <|endoftext|> Horror movies are so much fun to watch. When you can remember which ones you watched, do you mind telling me what you liked or didn't like about the movie? <|endoftext|> The Conjuring, Annabelle <|endoftext|> Annabelle, yes. I loved that movie! I totally recommend that you watch the Candyman trailer. Candyman is a movie about a black man who was murdered for being in love with a white woman. He is summoned to reality by a skeptic college graduate student who was infatuated with his story. <|endoftext|> That\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds a sequel with director Nia DeCosta <|endoftext|> There is a sequel coming out in June, yes. As I'm a big fan of the original 1992 movie, I think you would love it. <|endoftext|> I have to go see that one it looks interesting I took a peek at from my iPhone on imb.com reviews <|endoftext|> The one coming out in June? Yes, it looks to be quite promising. The 1992 film was absolutely amazing. I was re-watching the movie for the one millionth time last year and during my re-watch, when Candyman was being summoned, the power went out in my house. Talk about jump scare! I thought he was coming to my home. :D I think anyone who hasn't seen this movie, should definitely give it a try. It's got a great story, great actors and is plenty creepy. <|endoftext|> Watch out for the Candyman huh, I get into horror movies I might look up the 1992 and play it out and see if I can get down tot he movie theater in June when that one comes out. <|endoftext|> Oh, definitely! Tony Todd, the actor who plays Candyman in the 1992 film and the upcoming one is the perfect actor for this character. He has this deep voice that will send chills down your spine when you hear him speak. I absolutely love it. Can't get enough of it. <|endoftext|> Is he the character Anthony McCoy being played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in 2020? <|endoftext|> Somewhat, yes. Anthony McCoy is going to be a hallucinatory reflection of the Candyman. We will still hear Tony Todd's voice I believe and may even see him a few times in the 2020 film. Quite interesting. I have high hopes for the remake that's coming out later this year, but since we may not see Tony Todd much in the movie, I strongly recommend for you to see 1992 film. <|endoftext|> Ok do you know if it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds  on subscription streaming <|endoftext|> It is, yes! You can watch the movie on Netflix. <|endoftext|> I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll check it out if it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds on Netflix <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi! Nice to meet you! <|endoftext|> Can you tell me about what kinds of movie trailers you are interested in? <|endoftext|> Preferably, I would like to not know to not be able to guess the plot from the trailer. Just enough to see if the idea is interesting or not. <|endoftext|> Yes, that makes sense! What was the last movie you watched that you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I recently watched Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse and really enjoyed it! <|endoftext|> Oh, nice! What was your favorite thing about the movie? <|endoftext|> Honestly, I think it was just how stylish everything was. You could really tell a lot of love was put into it. <|endoftext|> That's a great observation. Have you seen the Star Wars movies? <|endoftext|> Many years ago, yes! I saw the original six growing up, but the new ones didn't interest me too much <|endoftext|> And are you a fan of the rest of the Marvel Universe? <|endoftext|> I'm not really sure. I haven't watched a lot of the MCU movies. <|endoftext|> Well, there are so many movies out there, it's hard to make time for all of them. <|endoftext|> That makes sense. I did enjoy the ones I did watch, such as the newest Thor and Doctor Strange. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen all of them either, but I also have enjoyed the ones I've watched. Many of the movies have a dramatic appeal-- is that something you enjoy? <|endoftext|> Oh yes! I love a good drama or thriller! <|endoftext|> Ooh, thrillers! I have to admit I am more the type to read the description on Wikipedia! Do you like being on the edge of your seat in a movie, or do you like everything to work out in the end? <|endoftext|> Edge of my seat, if possible. <|endoftext|> Okay! I personally enjoy movies with great cinematography, what about you? <|endoftext|> Absolutely! Thats what I love about a lot of Edgar Wright's movies. <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Black Panther? If not, I would recommend it! <|endoftext|> I have! And I agree, thats a really good recommendation! <|endoftext|> I have also heard that Ant Man is a popular one. <|endoftext|> I havent seen that yet, but now I guess that's my next to watch! Thank you! <|endoftext|> Great, I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> How ya doing? <|endoftext|> Pretty good, what about you? <|endoftext|> Good, thanks <|endoftext|> That's good <|endoftext|> So you watch any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Last movie I saw was Marvel Infinity Wars. It was good. <|endoftext|> I loved that movie! It was a really satisfying conclusion. What did you think? <|endoftext|> I really liked it and how it brought a lot of different characters together. <|endoftext|> Same. Are you excited for the new Thor movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, I loved Thor Ragnarok. <|endoftext|> Me too! I love that it went in a different direction than the others. More comedic. Kinda feel like rewatching it now that you mention it. Would you rewatch it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would definitely rewatch it. I agree that it was much funnier than the other Thor movies. <|endoftext|> Nice, that's great! <|endoftext|> Yep :) Thanks for the movie reccommendation. I think that I will go rewatch Thor Ragnarok. <|endoftext|> Haha cool! Oh yeah, and also loved the trailer. Might be worth a rewatch too <|endoftext|> Oh, thanks! I will look up the Trailer and give it a watch. <|endoftext|> Great use of Led Zeppelin <|endoftext|> Yes, defintely. Marvel always has great soundtracks. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> How are you today? <|endoftext|> Pretty good and yourself <|endoftext|> I'm doing well thank you! <|endoftext|> I am glad to hear that <|endoftext|> I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Yes, I am waiting for the movie trailer in order to give my appreciations. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> Romantic, Comedy <|endoftext|> Yes me too! What is the last movie you watched that you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw in a Theater was StarWars. And I see a lot of movies by platforms like Netflix. I just finished the 3 seasons of Outlander <|endoftext|> My son loves the Star wars Trilogy. Netflix is great! We watch movies on there all the time. <|endoftext|> I meant the last Starwars that was on the theaters last month. <|endoftext|> Oh I'm sorry. I'm not that familiar with Star Wars. My son and husband enjoy them. Have you seen any Good Boys yet? <|endoftext|> Yes, I like Starwars too, the first trilogy was release when I was a child, then after several years they release the second part of the trilogy and this last one is like a bonus. No, I have not seen Good Boys yet. What is about? <|endoftext|> It's pretty funny. I watched it with my teenagers. It's about these three 12-year-old boys who get invited to their first kissing party. So they decide to do some QUOTATION_MARKresearchQUOTATION_MARK and spy on the teenage girls next door. You can only imagine how crazy and out of hand things go from there. <|endoftext|> And it is on the theaters, or do you saw it in a platform? <|endoftext|> You can rent it on Amazon Prime, Vudu or Apple. Knives Out is at the theaters and I heard that is very funny. I have not had a chance to see it yet. <|endoftext|> I have Amazon Prime, so I can see it. Thanks for the recommendation. Yes, I saw the trailer of Knives Out, but I believe there is some violence in there <|endoftext|> Yeah I think you are right about Knives Out. Would you like me to link you to the trailers for those? <|endoftext|> for the one for Good Boys please Thank you very much. <|endoftext|> You're welcome. Have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer that you'd like to watch. <|endoftext|> Hi, I'm looking for a really good comedy that came out in the last year. <|endoftext|> Great! It was a good year for comedy movies. Do you have any age restriction or family friendly preferences? <|endoftext|> No age restriction, but something for teens and up please. <|endoftext|> Are you interested in super hero movies, even if they break the mold from the usual? <|endoftext|> no super hero movies <|endoftext|> Are you more a fan of cerebral comedies, slapstick, or something in between? <|endoftext|> more cereberal. I don't like slapstick. <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of crossing genres when it comes to comedy? <|endoftext|> yes i am <|endoftext|> I have one just for you! Knives Out comedic take on a murder mystery scenario, with strong characters and a plot that will keep you guessing. <|endoftext|> oh that looks good! thank you I accept this recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you will enjoy. <|endoftext|> Thanks so much. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I watched this movie in theaters on Christmas day. It was an interesting ride. <|endoftext|> nice. What is it rated? <|endoftext|> Knives Out is a PG-13 film. <|endoftext|> Who stars in it? <|endoftext|> It stars Ana de Armas, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Daniel Craig (personal favorite!) <|endoftext|> oh I love Daniel Craig. Ok, I'm excited to check it out. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, my name is Drake! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> What kind of movies are you most interested in? <|endoftext|> I really like action fantasy movies like Lord of the Rings and Marvel movies <|endoftext|> What do you like most about Marvel <|endoftext|> I like superhero backstories. Sometimes it's fun to see how an ordinary person can become extraordinary, and how they cope with having super powers and the responsibility to protect people but still try to live a regular life. I like how Marvel can tell an in depth story based off dozens of comic books in 2 hours. <|endoftext|> I was hoping you'd say that! Think about how crazy it must be to try and live a normal life when you have superpowers. Have you seen Avengers: Endgame? <|endoftext|> I have seen it. It was amazing. But also really depressing. <|endoftext|> I am in absolute agreement. Would you rewatch it again? <|endoftext|> I would probably watch it as part of a marathon because I couldn't watch it on its own, but yes I would watch it again. <|endoftext|> Would you be interested in watching Ant-Man? <|endoftext|> I have seen it and I enjoyed it. Could you recommend an older Marvel comics movie? <|endoftext|> I sure can! How about the Original Adventures of Captain Marvel, it was produced in 1941. <|endoftext|> Wow, that looks interesting. I think I would like to watch that. Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> Hmm, what do you find the most interesting about this one? <|endoftext|> Definitely the fact that it's a 12 part movie series. I will look into watching it. <|endoftext|> Hopefully, that will satisfy you Marvel craving for a while! <|endoftext|> It should for sure tide me over until the MCU releases more movies. lol <|endoftext|> Is there anything else I can help with today? <|endoftext|> Nope, I think that's it.:) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, how's it going? <|endoftext|> Hi! I'm doing well. Do you like movies? <|endoftext|> I do, I am also a big James Bond fan, so I am excited to see the new one. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen the trailer for that one yet. Is it still daniel craig? <|endoftext|> Yes it is. The trailers are really good, but it does help to be a fan and know about the last few movies. Make sure you catch it. <|endoftext|> I think the only Daniel Craig James Bond that I've seen was casino royale. There was an older one I saw a very long time ago with a ski lodge? but the memory is very fuzzy. Which Daniel Craig Bond films should I see before I watch the latest one? <|endoftext|> Well, I would suggest at least the last one, which is Spectre. What other type of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> A pretty wide variety if I'm being honest. I tend to lean towards action films; like Pacific Rim and Mad Max: Fury Road. Honestly if a movie involves a pretty woman controlling a big machine, I'll probably love it. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Haha. I tend to go that way too. I am also a huge Star wars fan. You'll definitely enjoy the new James Bond, action and story. <|endoftext|> Okay, I accept your recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> Enjoy, and I'm sure you'll check out the new Black Widow movie. <|endoftext|> I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of Marvel. I think I'm a bit burned out. I did like the most recent Thor movie though. It was a refreshing change of pace. <|endoftext|> Yeah, they do wear you out. <|endoftext|> did you see the trailer for promising young woman? <|endoftext|> No I haven't seen that one yet. <|endoftext|> It's a female revenge fantasy. I was super intrigued by it because I've never seen anything quite like it. <|endoftext|> cool, I'll check it out. <|endoftext|> Okay! Do you have a favorite stand-alone movie? <|endoftext|> My all time favorite is The Godfather. A classic <|endoftext|> I haven't seen the Godfather yet. I think there's a lot of classic films that I still need to watch. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> Hi, I am doing well. How are you? <|endoftext|> I am fine. What kind of movie trailer do you like? <|endoftext|> I like watching action and horror movies. <|endoftext|> What is the latest movie youn have watched and when? <|endoftext|> I recently watched Fantasy Island on Valentine's Day. It didn't really meet my expectations. <|endoftext|> What movie trailer have you recently watched and admire? <|endoftext|> I recently watched the trailer for Bloodshot and I thought it was very interesting. <|endoftext|> What is the name of the major actor in Fantasy Island that you watched on Valentine Day? <|endoftext|> The island's host was Mr. Roark <|endoftext|> I would like to recommend a movie titled QUOTATION_MARKTHE I-LANDQUOTATION_MARK. I bet you would like it. <|endoftext|> I will take that recommendation. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, let's watch the trailer <|endoftext|> Good. You would like it. <|endoftext|> I think the plot looks very interesting. What did you think about basing this plot on a simulation? <|endoftext|> Yes! The plots is very interesting <|endoftext|> It kind of reminds me of the movie Cast Away too <|endoftext|> Cool. Hope you have a good day ahead. <|endoftext|> I hope you have a great day too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Do you know what type of movie trailer you'd like to see? <|endoftext|> I like action movies. If not that then syfy and fantasy are also what i like <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched the My Hero Academia:Heroes Rising movie the other day. <|endoftext|> Nice! I just watch Ford V Ferrari. It was very good. <|endoftext|> Is that based on the real event? <|endoftext|> Yes. Carroll Shelby and British car driver Ken Miles are fighting the big wigs at Ford trying to convince them that they could build a race car to beat Ferrari. <|endoftext|> Sounds cool, i watched a documentary on the event awhile back. Are the lead actors good? This might be something im interested in. <|endoftext|> Matt Damon and Christain Bale. Both awesome actors. Well worth watching. I highly recommend it. <|endoftext|> What others movie would you recommend? <|endoftext|> I loved the Martian with Matt Damon. It's older but definitely worth watching. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, it was very good. I have the book on my desk, currently rereading it. The movie is very powerful. <|endoftext|> Excellent!! I could watch that one a million times. I've not read the book. I will check it out. <|endoftext|> I think i might check it out again. I accept that recommendation. <|endoftext|> I think I will have to watch it again also. <|endoftext|> What other Matt damon movies do you recommend? I think hes a very good actor. <|endoftext|> We bought a zoo actually was excellent! <|endoftext|> Is it about buying a zoo? Sounds like a comedy <|endoftext|> It's actually a drama. He's a journalist that loses his wife and decides to quit his job and buy a defunct wildlife park. <|endoftext|> oh wow, that wasnt what i expected. That sounds really good. Is he using the zoo as a way to overcome the lose of his wife? <|endoftext|> Yeah. Scarlett Johansson is in it too so there's a little QUOTATION_MARKeye candyQUOTATION_MARK too. But it's good. <|endoftext|> Eye Candy is always good, lol. Did you watch this movie in a theater, or somewhere else? <|endoftext|> I actually saw it in a theater. I watch a lot of movies. Matt Damon is definitely one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> Okay, i think i might check that out. Always thought it was a comedy and not a drame. <|endoftext|> It's a little funny also of course. There are at least two other ones that I would recommend. <|endoftext|> What are they? <|endoftext|> The Informant and Promised Land. Both are excellent. Both based on true stories. <|endoftext|> whats the informant about? <|endoftext|> It's about a guy that work for an agriculture corp Archer Daniels Midland. He is a bit of an espionage nut so he finds out they are involved in a price fixing conspiracy and he informs the FBI. And then they get him to wear a wire. It's really good and a bit funny also. <|endoftext|> And what about Promised Land? I dont think im feeling The Informant. <|endoftext|> Matt Damon again of course. He's a salesman for a natural gas company and he's trying to secure the drilling rights for the natural gas company. The town is desperate so they will accept anything. There is a school teacher (Hal Holbrook) and he's trying to stop the company. Matt Damon is torn. It's good. <|endoftext|> Oh that sounds good. Now im torn between We Bought a Zoo and Promised Land. Of the two which might you recommend more? <|endoftext|> We bought a zoo is a bit funnier so depending on your mood. But both are quite good. <|endoftext|> Alright,i think i made up my mind. I am going to check out We Bought a Zoo. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> ok! <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> i like dramatic movies with good dialogue, and action. i like suspense in movies <|endoftext|> Would you say you like psychological thrillers? <|endoftext|> yes, definately <|endoftext|> I do too! One of my favorites is Shutter Island, have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> yes, i saw it awhile ago, i dont remember it too well. i like leonardo dicaprio <|endoftext|> I also like Leo. Did you ever see Inception? <|endoftext|> yes, i love that movie <|endoftext|> I do too. I definitely watched it at least 5 times! What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> the last movie i watched was goodfellas <|endoftext|> I like Goodfellas as well. It seems like we have a lot of movie preferences in common. I recommend watching Gone Girl. It is a psychological thriller with lots of great dialogue and plenty of twists and turns. It stars big names such as: Ben Affleck, Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry. <|endoftext|> ok, i will definately give it a try, thank you <|endoftext|> Great! Thanks for chatting with me. I hope you have a great day! <|endoftext|> you too <|endoftext|> I believe you will be directed to the trailer for this movie after this chat is complete <|endoftext|> ok, if you had to rate the movie out of 10 stars, what would you guve it? <|endoftext|> I personally would give it a 9 out of 10. I am usually pretty good at seeing how things end, but I was not able to figure out this ending. It definitely has a great element of mystery to it. There are a couple times where you wish it would pick up a little bit which is why I am giving it a 9, but it's definitely worth watching <|endoftext|> ok, im looking foward to watching the trailer. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Cool. Do you know any good movies out now? <|endoftext|> Yes I totally do!

Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn) is certified Fresh with an 87% Rotten Tomatoes score from more than 124 reviews <|endoftext|> That sounds like a good movie. Who directed it? <|endoftext|> OH! Cathy Yan she is a Chinese-born American film director, screenwriter, and producer. Her films include the comedy-drama film Dead Pigs <|endoftext|> Wow, super cool. I think I'll like this movie I will take your recommendation! Thank You! <|endoftext|> unfortunately Birds of prey is not on my list, BUT if you like that movie Black panther is really good too! <|endoftext|> OK, what is Black Panther? <|endoftext|> Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and honestly, I feel Marvel as a stuido was starting to slip But Black panther really put them back on track <|endoftext|> Oh ok, what kind of ratings does it have? <|endoftext|> Rating: PG-13 and it has a 97 percent on rotten tomatoes. <|endoftext|> How long is the movie? <|endoftext|> 2h 15m but it is a really fast paced movie, lots of action and just moves your through the story smoothly. <|endoftext|> This sounds cool, who directed it? <|endoftext|> Ryan Kyle Coogler, he is an American film director, producer, and screenwriter. His first feature film, Fruitvale Station, won the top audience and grand jury awards in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. <|endoftext|> I see it is not in theaters anymore, what streaming service can I watch it on? <|endoftext|> You can watch is on Netflix right now and its about to move over to Disney + next month. Its got to be one of my Favorite Marval movies of all time! <|endoftext|> Sounds great. I'll accept this recommendation.

What's the last movie you watched, and did you actually enjoy it? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was Zombieland. I love watching zombie movies and this movie is quite different from other movies of this kind because it isn't dark.....it brings in comedy and is more fun. I like the actors too, they have great synergy with one another and makes it more enjoyable to watch <|endoftext|> That's a creepy and definitely a good one! The actors in that one are good! I love almost all of the movies that Emma Stone plays in. A good comedy horror is nice too as long as they don't get too cheesy. Are you wanting to watch something along the same lines as Zombieland or do you want to reach for something different this round? <|endoftext|> I could definitely go for something different this time around. I like watching different types of movies <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen or heard of A Haunted House? its definitely a good comedy with a little fantasy to it and it's not overly cheesy either. <|endoftext|> Yes I have heard of A Haunted House and would consider watching it.

Those are hilarious in my opinion! <|endoftext|> Absolutely! I've seen all of the above! My family is full of movie buffs. I even enjoyed Little Man when it came out. If you havent seen that, it's also a must see <|endoftext|> Oh for sure I've seen Little Man. It's nice to know someone else watches similar movies. <|endoftext|> Agreed! Well enjoy your movie!! <|endoftext|> Ok bye! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good day! I am here to interest you in some movie trailers :) <|endoftext|> Hey, how's it going? Sounds like someone tattled on me. XD Yeah, I was actually hoping to find something to watch later. <|endoftext|> Very well thank you for asking! Are there any genres you are into? Or perhaps willing to discover new genres? <|endoftext|> I've always been a fan of comedy stuff but I've never passed up a good cartoon either. That said, if you got an odd one on the brain, I'm open to new ideas. <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I love to expand people's interest in movies. What movies have you watched lately that have sparked your interest in this genre? <|endoftext|> In which genre? Recent movies I've seen include; Deadpool 2, DOOM, Kung Foo Panda, Avengers: EndGame... I'm all over the map, I know. <|endoftext|> Comedy and animated! That is a great selection of movies under your belt there :D Based on your choices, I have managed to come up with a movie that is both comedy and animated. It is called Sausage Party featuring Seth Rogan, James Franco, and Jonah Hill! <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! That was actually on my list of 'Things to Watch' and I guess I just forgot about it. That's the one with the Supermarket foods right? Like Toy Story but for adults? <|endoftext|> You got it! It is very entertaining with its content, but also very pleasing for the eyes with so many colors! <|endoftext|> Bright colors AND entertaining. This pleases me. :|  I guess I know what I'm watching later. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Got it, I hope you enjoy your movie! <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will. I meant to see it when it was still in theaters. <|endoftext|> There is nothing like watching it in the comfort of your home though! <|endoftext|> Right? Plus the last time I checked it was on Netflix, so basically free. <|endoftext|> ANOTHER WIN! :D That's my favorite part of it all. I was also thinking you could watch a more family friend cartoon if you needed a more family oriented movie. <|endoftext|> Oh the wife already has a movie planned for the next 'Family Movie'. Frozen 2. She's nuts for Elsa. <|endoftext|> WONDERFUL watch! Beautiful movie for both kids and adults. Another beautiful cartoon is Coco, fantastic for the family! <|endoftext|> I love Coco. It's one of those few cartoons that makes you sad even as an adult. So much passion in that movie. <|endoftext|> That movie always gets me! I agree, that movie was definitely a tear jerker. I believe onward is another movie that has a deep family meaning behind it. <|endoftext|> I'll have to look into that one too... For the moment though, I think Sausage Party is the go-to. Knowing I missed one on my list is going to bug me until I watch it. <|endoftext|> Perfect! Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I think I'm gonna do that now. Thanks again. <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I hope you enjoy it! My pleasure :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you today? <|endoftext|> VERY WELL AND YOU? <|endoftext|> I am great thank you!

I really liked Birdman. That is kind of a comedy. And I saw Ocean's 11 recently too. Loved that one a lot <|endoftext|> Are there any actors/actresses you really like? <|endoftext|> Bill Murray is great. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Zombieland?

Where can I see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Once we are done chatting you will be able to watch the trailer! <|endoftext|> Okay, thanks for the recommendation. I think I'll really like it. Bye! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> So what kid of movies do you like? What's the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> I like sci-fi/fantasty movies! I think the last one I saw was actually the Star Wars finale! <|endoftext|> What did you enjoy the most about Star Wars? <|endoftext|> I liked the storytelling and the cinematography. It was a really beautiful movie even if there were a lot of fan service moments. And of course, the droids. <|endoftext|> Do you think you would enjoy a more serious film or one with comedic moments? <|endoftext|> I prefer serious over QUOTATION_MARKtrash humorQUOTATION_MARK, if that makes sense. I don't like movies with crass humor. I like good stories <|endoftext|> Yeah, I agree. I really enjoy the Star Wars films, and I'm always on the lookout to find similar movies. I enjoy the action-adventure type movies with a healthy mix of a good story with appropriate humor. <|endoftext|> As long as there's no severe violence I'm good! I like action and suspense but if there's chopping of limbs or impaling or jump scares I'm out haha. <|endoftext|> Would you be open to see a movie you've already seen? Or would you rather see a new film? <|endoftext|> I'd be open to one I've already seen! I like to rewatch films to catch things I didn't last time - or, knowing the ending, see how things lead up to the ending with that knowledge in mind. <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the Marvel films? <|endoftext|> I have!I watched all of them in chronological order last year - was a really fun way to watch them. I don't know that I ever saw a trailer for any of the earlier ones, though. I didn't start watching them until Guardians of the Galaxy 2 <|endoftext|> One of my favorites is the first Guardians of the Galaxy. I think it's really funny, and it had a very different mood than the previous Marvel films. Plus I really like Chris Pratt as an actor! <|endoftext|> I agree! And it does a perfect balance of humor and story - I laughed out loud so many times. And the music is really good too, of course. The cast is fantastic. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer for it, for old times sake? <|endoftext|> I would love to!! Let's watch it :D <|endoftext|> Sounds great! <|endoftext|> Thanks for the chat and the great recommendation!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> hello! <|endoftext|> how are you today? <|endoftext|> very good and you? <|endoftext|> I am great. Do you like movies? <|endoftext|> I'm superfan of it <|endoftext|> what is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> jojo rabbit <|endoftext|> I have no heard of that movie <|endoftext|> it was an oscar nominee.. its about world war two <|endoftext|> oh nice that sounds like an intersting movie. What other kinds of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like comedy, can you recommend me any good one? <|endoftext|> The hangover is a really funny comedy <|endoftext|> you are right <|endoftext|> mrs. doubtfire is another good movie <|endoftext|> I would love to watch it... do you have another in mind? <|endoftext|> instant family <|endoftext|> thank u so much for your recommendations, I will check them out <|endoftext|> great i hope that you enjoy them <|endoftext|> well I will trust your taste :) <|endoftext|> thank you enjoy <|endoftext|> you shoul watch jojo rabbit too <|endoftext|> I will definetly check that out <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello!

He has a surprising range. <|endoftext|> is it in theaters now? i'd like to see the trailer <|endoftext|> It was recently released for Home Release & DVD, I'll try to find a link for a trailer <|endoftext|> ok, that works <|endoftext|> It has QUOTATION_MARKGladiator StyleQUOTATION_MARK fighting, which seems kind of fun. <|endoftext|> what other actors are in the movie? <|endoftext|> Samara Weaving and Rhys Darby <|endoftext|> ok, i accept that recommendation :) <|endoftext|> The trailer for that is not available here. I am sending you the trailer for Bad Boys 3. I hope you enjoy them both! <|endoftext|> ok thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how is your day <|endoftext|> Hey there! It's been pretty good. I've been looking for something interesting to watch lately. <|endoftext|> What kind of things do you like to watch. <|endoftext|> I tend to lean more towards horror movies but I have a guilty pleasure for romantic comedy, too. <|endoftext|> I love to watch horror movies myself! What is the last move that you have seen? <|endoftext|> It's been awhile since I've watched a good horror movie. I think the last one that I watched was probably IT and I tend to watch the Scream movies over and over again. I like good horror movies that make you think, have good characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat. <|endoftext|> Those are the best kinds of movies when you are on the edge of your seat. I love that penny wise smile, nothing will ever compare to it. Have you ever seen any of the Insidious series? <|endoftext|> I don't think that I have! Are they any good? What are they about? <|endoftext|> They are one of my favorite scary movies. They all follow a different person every movie but it is about someone being taken into a different dimension of the world they live in. <|endoftext|> That sounds like it perfectly describes a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seat. Just my kind of movie! I'd love to give them a try and start watching as soon as I can. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> They are a little bit of an older movie but I really enjoy them and will watch them over and over. <|endoftext|> They sound like a perfect recommendation for me! <|endoftext|> The movie has had 8 wins and 15 nominations for awards. <|endoftext|> How do you feel about the acting in the movie? Is it cheesy or do they do a nice job? <|endoftext|> They did a very nice job acting and selecting the actors and actresses for the movie. <|endoftext|> Okay, awesome. I think you had me at QUOTATION_MARKbeing taking into different dimensionsQUOTATION_MARK I love this suggestion. Thank you! <|endoftext|> To be more accurate it is called QUOTATION_MARKThe FartherQUOTATION_MARK and it really makes you think about if it could happen in reality or not. <|endoftext|> How many movies are in the series? <|endoftext|> There are 4 movies with the first movie coming out in 2010 and the most recent coming out in 2018. <|endoftext|> Okay that sounds perfect. It gives me plenty of movies to go ahead and watch. <|endoftext|> Yes, and you will be able to watch them over and over to understand them a little better. <|endoftext|> Sounds great. Thank you so much! <|endoftext|> Anytime, I like to help anytime I can. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there.

Did you like it? <|endoftext|> It was saw great, i loved it <|endoftext|> Me too. Why did you like it? The action? The actors? <|endoftext|> The action, pushing the envelope as a courageous test pilot and dodging the advancement in rank that would ground him. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it in a long time, but I do watch little bits and pieces if it's on TV. Funny that they're making a sequel 35 years later. <|endoftext|> Yes, but whats your favorite Trailer for the year <|endoftext|> Trailer? Probably James Bond, No Time to Die. Or Top Gun 2. Lol. <|endoftext|> Awesome i thing i prefer the Top Gun2 <|endoftext|> Would you watch the trailer for it? <|endoftext|> Yes I am so much interested <|endoftext|> Honestly, I've seen a bunch of times.

Have you seen any of these <|endoftext|> I have not seen any of the Die Hard movies, but I love Bruce Willis's movies. Ive seen all of Tom Cruises mission impossibles. I really liked Tom Cruise in the Jack Reacher movies. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher movies,  Bruce Willis also has a action, comedy movie called Venice made in 2017 so it hasnt been made that long ago. He is still out there. <|endoftext|> You should defenitley give the Jack Reacher movies a watch. They are very good. I havent really seen anything by Bruce Willis in about the past 10 years. Ive seen most of his movies from the 90's and early 00's. Pulp fiction is my favorite, which made me like Travolta. Travolta's from Paris with Love is one of my favorites from him, have you seen it? <|endoftext|> The most recent movie with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson working alongside each other is GLASS. Just arrived in 2019.Would you like to see this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yea sure. Is that the movie that was a sequel to the movie Split? <|endoftext|> I havent seen Travolta's movie. Glass and Split are made by the same director and have similar story lines but i dont see where they are a sequel thought it is possible. <|endoftext|> Ah ok that movies another you should watch. I thought Glass would be a sequel to it cause it looked the same character was in that movie as well. I haven't seen either so thats how I made the assumption. I just watched the trailer for Glass. <|endoftext|> Yes, it is the sequel after reading futher. I hope you will enjoy the recommendations and have a great movie night. Good day to you. <|endoftext|> Thank you, I wish you the same. I enjoyed discussing these movies with you :) <|endoftext|> Same :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, what type of movies do you like watching? <|endoftext|> Hi, I love sci-fi, action and horror movies. <|endoftext|> I like the action and horror more byut not so keen on sci-fi lol...what is the lastest horror movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched The Dark Stranger, it was cool. <|endoftext|> I have 3 kids so i get stuck watching alot of disney movies do you enjoy them at all? <|endoftext|> 3 kids hu? Disney has some great films for kids and families. I've watched a few. <|endoftext|> My baby girl loves the frozen movies, I think they went over board with the first but liked the sencond and was kind of impressed. Did you see either one of them? <|endoftext|> Frozen was great. I liked the computer graphics and the plot. I've heard lots of kids love the Frozen movies. <|endoftext|> I recommend the 2nd if you havent seen it yet, it has some pretty cool parts. <|endoftext|> I want to see it. I saw a trailer of it and it looks so pretty. The characters are pretty and funny. <|endoftext|> So do you accept the recommendation to watch frozen 2? <|endoftext|> Yeah, thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Cool!

Would you like a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> I totally would. <|endoftext|> Sounds good. What are your favorite types of movies? <|endoftext|> I love science fiction and adventure flicks. <|endoftext|> Ok, are you looking for a movie that is out at the theater, or something you can watch at home? <|endoftext|> got any good ones on Netflix to catch? <|endoftext|> I can take a look, could you tell me some of your favorite actors or actresses? <|endoftext|> um. not particularly in those kinds of movies. <|endoftext|> Do you like the marvel movies? Like Avengers, etc? <|endoftext|> I actually haven't seen many of them. do you have any you recommend I see? I have DIsney Plus <|endoftext|> The two best ones are the two part Avengers Inifnity Wars and Avengers Endgame. I would recommend those with Inifnity War first. If you are looking for a more standalone movie I would recommend Doctor Strange or Captain America: Winter Soldier. <|endoftext|> Oh ok. So would I be confused if I jumped right into the first two? I shouldn't get some back story first? <|endoftext|> It would help, but you would really have to essentailly watch all of the marvel movies in order, lol. But if you wanted a good one to start off with that everyone seems to enjoy, I would go with Captain America: Winter Soldier. It has 4 of the avengers in it, provides plenty of backstory and is more of an action/spy movie than a traditional superhero movie. <|endoftext|> Great! thanks for the recommendation. It's kind of intimidating to think IQUOTATION_MARKd have to watch all of them. I appreciate your help and insight. <|endoftext|> You're welcome, is that a movie that you would like to watch? <|endoftext|> Yes. I think IQUOTATION_MARKd like to start off with Captain America tonight. Thanks for your help. Have a great afternoon! <|endoftext|> Ok great, I will put that in for you. <|endoftext|> Awesome!

What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like documentaries and dramas, sometimes comedies. <|endoftext|> Cool! I would recommend American Factory first, it won this year for the 2020 Best Documentary Academy Award! <|endoftext|> Oooh, that sounds cool! I will put that on my watch list. I am looking for a recommendation for a drama. Do you have one? <|endoftext|> I recently watched Uncut Gems with Adam Sandler, directed by the Safdie brothers. It's a fast-paced drama about a jewelry dealer in New York. Adam Sandler is outstanding in it! <|endoftext|> That sounds just like what I am looking for. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> Awesome! Have a great day. <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|> Oh, wait! I think we need to chat more. Which comedies do you like? I'd like to find one of those for you. <|endoftext|> I like silly slapstick comedies, like some of Will Ferrel's stuff. Anything light and easy to watch. <|endoftext|> I love Will Ferrel's stuff, Step Brothers is one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> Step Brothers is good, but I have seen it. Anything else you would recommend? Maybe something with Paul Rudd? <|endoftext|> Role Models is a light-hearted Paul Rudd movie with some great kid actors and a good message. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a fun movie to watch! I accept your recommendation! Thanks! <|endoftext|> Absolutely! Glad I could help. <|endoftext|> Can you maybe offer another film in case that one doesn't pan out? <|endoftext|> I think I've got an Adam Sandler drama/comedy that might up your alley! how about 50 First Dates with him and Drew Barrymore? <|endoftext|> I have heard good things about it but haven't seen it yet. I will put that on my watch list as well. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. How can I help you? <|endoftext|> Hi. Have you seen any good movies lately? I love historical movies. <|endoftext|> Yes I have. If I may ask, what was the last historical movie you saw that you really enjoyed? <|endoftext|> What comes to mind is Gone With The Wind. It was such a sweepoing saga that covered years of the characters life and the many changes they undergo. <|endoftext|> Oh yes. I loved Gone With The Wind. Have you seen Ben Hur? I highly recommend that movie. <|endoftext|> Yes, I have seen that movie also, another good one. I loved Charleston Heston in that movie. Are there any modern historical movies that you have seen lately? <|endoftext|> Well, Schindler's List comes to mind. It's very emotional and moving. <|endoftext|> I have seen that one also, it was very good and very moving. Have you seen 1917, I am thinking of checking that one out. <|endoftext|> I have. It's a tense movie because the director shot it in a way that it appears everything is in one take. So you feel like you're right there with them. Great movie. Too bad it didn't win best picture this year. <|endoftext|> Great, I am going to go see it on your recommendation. Thanks a lot. Have a good day. <|endoftext|> Thank you. Same to you.

Maybe I will watch a few of the again, along with the new movie 1917. <|endoftext|> Great. Glad I could help.

Another movie to add to my list. <|endoftext|> Nice. Your list is growing with great movies! Enjoy your day. <|endoftext|> Yes, since tomorrow is Saturday I think I am going to definitely see 1917, and go on from there. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Hacksaw Ridge! I forgot about that one. It stars Andrew Garfield. (He was Spiderman). But after a few moments, you will forget he was Spiderman because he gives such a powerful performance! <|endoftext|> Thanks, another good one. Have a great day and thanks for your help. Bye. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> well, thank you <|endoftext|> That's great!

Do you have a preference on what kind of movies you like to see? <|endoftext|> I would like  asci-fi or fantasy movie, preferably one that is a comedy, or a movie that is a period drama <|endoftext|> Great! I love those as well. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was Willow <|endoftext|> That's a classic fantasy! I personally love movies like the Princess Bride. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> Yes it's one of my favorites <|endoftext|> What was your favorite part? I have several. <|endoftext|> There are so many good parts! I do love the Cliffs of Insanity fight scene <|endoftext|> That is one of my favorites. That and QUOTATION_MARKMy name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to dieQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Me too! <|endoftext|> Are you looking for an epic adventure or more of a fantastical comedy? <|endoftext|> Oh that's tough. I'd be happy with both <|endoftext|> Have you seen, QUOTATION_MARKRobin Hood, men in TightsQUOTATION_MARK? It has the same actor, Cary Elwes, in the leading role. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I have seen it <|endoftext|> Another Classic in my opinion. So, are you looking for something older like that or more modern? <|endoftext|> Older I think <|endoftext|> What about Bill and Ted's excellent Adventure? <|endoftext|> I've seen that one too <|endoftext|> What about Spaceballs? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one yet <|endoftext|> It is a Mel Brooks classic. Definitely falls under the fantastical comedy genre. <|endoftext|> Cool. I'll check it out <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! how are you? <|endoftext|> I am great thanks <|endoftext|> So any plans this weekend, heading to the movies perhaps? <|endoftext|> not this week, but i may rent one on fandango <|endoftext|> I love staying in and watching movies, any certain type you looking for? <|endoftext|> Maybe action comic book like Xmen or Spiderman <|endoftext|> Are you into the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies? I have watched all of them I love those superheroes movies I consider myself a bit of an expert. <|endoftext|> For the momst part I have. I have watched all the Xmen movies except Dark Phoenix. I would say that this is my favorite series.. <|endoftext|> I love the X-men movies as well I watched Dark Phoenix it was a solid close to the series, not the best one. Have you watched spiderman movies lately? <|endoftext|> I have watched all of them with the actor Tom Holland- so the newer series. I havent seen the old ones <|endoftext|> A lot of people love the classic trilogy with Toby Maguire if you like the ones with Tom Holland you should try to watch the first one. It's a lot more true to the comiics so if you were looking for a comic movie youd find it here. <|endoftext|> Cool can you send me a recommendation <|endoftext|> Cool I slected it now, it's Spider-Man (2002) main actor Toby Maguire and director Sam Raimi <|endoftext|> Okay sounds good I will see if I can try to rent it on my television screen. Do we have a plan? <|endoftext|> Yes I hope you enjoy! Make sure to watch the whole trilogy if you like it! <|endoftext|> okay thank you I will <|endoftext|> You're really in for a treat if you like comics. <|endoftext|> sounds like it i will enjoy it thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> No problem superhero movies is what I do <|endoftext|> okay ill tell you how it goes <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> hi how are you <|endoftext|> iler <|endoftext|> so i'm looking for a movie rec <|endoftext|> What kind of movie are you looking for? <|endoftext|> I like most genres, but looking for something fun that distracts me <|endoftext|> current or dvd <|endoftext|> current. not a fan of horror but i don't mind suspense <|endoftext|> How about Onward. Tom Holland, Chris Pratt are both in this movie <|endoftext|> ok that sounds good <|endoftext|> Happy you are okay with the choice <|endoftext|> yes, thank you <|endoftext|> anything I can help you with? <|endoftext|> that one is animated, yes? <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> i think ive seen it on tv <|endoftext|> That is good to hear <|endoftext|> it's the magic one? <|endoftext|> yes it is <|endoftext|> ok thanks so much <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Just great. And you? <|endoftext|> I am doing well, thank you for asking. <|endoftext|> What are you doing today? Anything interesting or fun? <|endoftext|> I am enjoying a movie! Do you enjoy watching movies as well? <|endoftext|> Oh, yes, I very much enjoy watching movies. <|endoftext|> Excellent! What kind of movies do you tend to watch in your spare time? <|endoftext|> I like action/adventure the most <|endoftext|> Awesome, I do too. I recently watched a few good action/adventure movies on netflix and in the theatres. I really enjoyed watching Jumaji: The Next Level. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen it yet <|endoftext|> It's an excellent movie that has elements of both action and adventure. Plus, there are many great actors that add a lot of comedy to it. I am a big fan of Duane QUOTATION_MARKThe RockQUOTATION_MARK Johnson, Jack Black and Danny DeVito. They all did an amazing job! <|endoftext|> Right. The Rock, Jack Black and Danny DeVito are hilarious actors. I also really enjoy a good myster or thriller with a complicated plot! <|endoftext|> I agree. Mystery/Thriller movies are among the best and I too enjoy a good mystery/thriller. Have you heard of the movie QUOTATION_MARKMurder on the Orient ExpressQUOTATION_MARK? It has an amazing script and story that kept me guessing until the end! <|endoftext|> yes, I saw it that film many years ago. I really enjoyed the thrilling twisted plot. You're right it kept me guessing right til the end. <|endoftext|> /Indeed, I agree. I forgot to ask, have you seen the first installment of the new Jumaji? Is there another movie trailer you would like to discuss for possible viewing <|endoftext|> I have not seen the first installment of the new Jumanji. I loved the original with Robin Williams. I saw a trailer for Avator recently. A sci-fi fantasy genre that looked very interesting and beautiful special effects. <|endoftext|> I remember you saying that QUOTATION_MARKThe Rock, Jack Black are hilarious actors.QUOTATION_MARK They did a great job in both movies. The new Jumaji took the original story in a different direction from the original film, which is something I enjoyed and respect immensely. Would you like to see this trailer? Otherwise, we can discuss the incredible film QUOTATION_MARKAvatorQUOTATION_MARK, which was directed by James Cameron. as you may know, he is a very accomplished director. <|endoftext|> I think that would be a terrific idea to watch the Jumaji trailer, yes. Looking forward to that! <|endoftext|> Great! I think it is something you will enjoy based on our conversation. I hope you have a wonderful day! Enjoy the trailer. <|endoftext|> You as well enjoy the day! <|endoftext|> Jumaji: Welcome to the Jungle <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> ok im here <|endoftext|> What type of movies interest you? <|endoftext|> comedies or lifetime movies <|endoftext|> Those are great choices! Do you have any particular actors that are you favorites? <|endoftext|> jamie fox, ice cube, mike epps <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed the QUOTATION_MARKRide AlongQUOTATION_MARK movies with Ice Cube and Kevin Hart. They both kept me laughing! Are you familiar with those films? <|endoftext|> no i would like to see trailer <|endoftext|> That sounds great! You can watch the trailer for Ride Along, and if you enjoy that you may also want to check out the trailer for Ride Along 2. <|endoftext|> ok thank you very much <|endoftext|> I'm accessing that trailer for you now. <|endoftext|> ok sounds good <|endoftext|> I think you will enjoy Kevin Hart's small, comedic character next to Ice Cube's large, serious character. <|endoftext|> oh wow ice cube is serious lol now thats funny <|endoftext|> Later, you may want to check out his earlier films- the QUOTATION_MARKAre We There Yet?QUOTATION_MARK films. They are more family oriented, and I know you mentioned Lifetime movies. <|endoftext|> yes do u have recommendations <|endoftext|> I prefer the Ride Along films, but they are more adult oriented. If you will be watching with children, you might try QUOTATION_MARKAre We There YetQUOTATION_MARK. <|endoftext|> yes thank u i have seen that one before pretty funny <|endoftext|> If you like Kevin Hart, he does a fantastic job in QUOTATION_MARKCentral IntelligenceQUOTATION_MARK with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. He does such a great job opposite larger costars. It makes for great comedy! <|endoftext|> ok thank you <|endoftext|> Here is the Ride Along trailer you requested. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you? <|endoftext|> I am doing well, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing alright. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds of movies. I am especially into syfi films but I like to watch everything. <|endoftext|> Nice! I'm a avid horror watcher myself but I do enjoy some SciFi. What's the last movie you've watched that you've enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I love horror movies too. I watch Doctor Sleep the other day. <|endoftext|> Ooh. That's one I want to see. How was it? I finally watched the new Child's Play the other day, it made me laugh more than be scared. When it comes to SciFi, are you more Fifth Element, Aliens, Stranger Things or Star Trek? <|endoftext|> It was good not a bad movie, but of course nothing in comparison to its original The Shining. But definitely a movie to check out. Fifth Element is awesome and I love Stranger Things. No so much of a Star Trek fan but Ive seen all the movies. <|endoftext|> Right, The Shining was a staple thriller/horror. It was jst interesting to see how they brought that into Doctor Sleep. Fifth Element is my movie. I've been trying to keep up with Stranger Things but my the wee ones won't allow it. Star Trek and Star Wars aren't on my go to list but I will watch them if I have to. <|endoftext|> OMG, you have to finish watching Stranger Things lol. A new trailer for season 4 just came out. I cant wait for the new season. <|endoftext|> I knowwww. I haven't even got to start season 2. I'm behind. I also have to check out locke and key. I heard its really good. <|endoftext|> Dude, I just finished watching Locke and Key with my daughter. We were hooked. <|endoftext|> I'm about to go turn it on in a second. Have you seen Escape Room? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. Any good? <|endoftext|> Yes, Its really good. It gives you thriller and horror all in one. They are coming out with Escape Room 2 this year. You should definitely check it out. I'm anticipating Escape Room 2 release. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, I heard of it but didnt know they were coming out with a part 2. <|endoftext|> Yes, there's some known actors in it, as well as some new faces. Originally I thought it'd be cliche but they executed it well. Interested in watching the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, sounds like a good movie. Sounds suspenseful. <|endoftext|> It is. You'll definitely enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation, will check it. Sounds like a good flick to watch with the family tonight. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I am supper, thank you. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like marvel movies. <|endoftext|> Those are great ones, whay is your favorite thing about them? <|endoftext|> I am a avid comic book collector and have many iron man, hulk, avenger comics. <|endoftext|> That's pretty cool.

I really like anything other than war movies or movies where animals die. Any reccomendations? <|endoftext|> I really like To All the Boys I've Loved Before!:) <|endoftext|> Hmmm, I have never heard about that. What genre is it? Plot good? <|endoftext|> It's a high school romantic movie! It'sreally good! If romantic movies aren't your thing I like Ralph Breaks the Internet! It's a super happy movie! <|endoftext|> I do like a good romantic movie. I think I will check out your reccomendation! Thank you. <|endoftext|> No problem!:) <|endoftext|> Have a good night! <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|> Oh, by the way, what year was this movie released? <|endoftext|> 2018! The sequel (To All the Boys: PS 1 Still Love You) came out this year <|endoftext|> Great. I tend not to like older movies (pre-1985). I will have to check out the sequel also! <|endoftext|> I'm glad! :) Do you have any other questions? <|endoftext|> I don't think so. Thanks for all the help! <|endoftext|> No problem! <|endoftext|> Sorry, actually I have to know, are romantic movies your favorite? <|endoftext|> Yeah! I'm a big softy :) Are romantic movies your favorite? <|endoftext|> Definetely, some of my favorite. Especially romantic comedies. I have to admit I even love me some cheesy Hallmark movies. Do you ever watch any of those? <|endoftext|> I haven't since Christmas, they're SUPER cheesy! <|endoftext|> Lol, they really are, but have been a good family tradition since I was little. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Have you seen any awesome movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes I have. I've seen 1917 and Joker. <|endoftext|> Nice, Joker is a wonderful movie, Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor. I have not seen 1917, what is it about? <|endoftext|> It is about World War I and two British soldiers going behind enemy lines to save over a thousand of their fellow soldiers.It was very suspenseful. <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting, I definitely have to check it out. If you enjoy movies about war I highly recommend Dunkirk. <|endoftext|> I have hard of Dunkirk but haven't seen that one. I like such movies that are based on history and full of suspense and have surprise endings. I will have to check that one out. <|endoftext|> You'll love Dunkirk, it is about the Allied evacuation of France during World War 2. It's a drama, but there is plenty of action. Have you seen Saving Private Ryan? <|endoftext|> Yes I have seen Saving Private Ryan some years ago. It was one of my favorites, well acted with a great plot and plenty of action. <|endoftext|> Definitely agree, also the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan are easily some of the best in cinema history. Steven Spielberg is a genius. Do you enjoy super hero movies? <|endoftext|> No, Super Hero Movies not as much, I do like the Batman franchise though. I will definitely take your recommendation for Dunkirk. <|endoftext|> I'm glad to hear it. If you don't mind me asking, what are your dislikes about super hero franchises? <|endoftext|> I find Super Hero movies too predictable and repetitious of previous super hero movies. <|endoftext|> Ah alright, and out of the Batman franchise, what are your likes? <|endoftext|> Dark Knight, Justice League, Joker <|endoftext|> Cool, between Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix whom do you think is the better joker? <|endoftext|> I prefer Joaquin Phoenix but Heath Ledger was quite good also. I just thinkg Joaquiin plays a darker  deranged character <|endoftext|> Agreed, Joaquin plays a more down to earth Joker. While I feel Ledger's joker is more stylized, I think he's more like the comic book version overall. Did you like Suicide Squad? <|endoftext|> I can't say I did. I didn't like the actors and overall theme of the movie. <|endoftext|> It certainly was lukewarm, thought Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn was wonderful. Did you watch Harley Quinn:Birds of Prey? <|endoftext|> No, Harley Quinn Birds of Prey I have NOT seen. <|endoftext|> My girlfriend loved it, good movie to watch as a couple. Well that is all for now, thank you! And enjoy Dunkirk, you won't regret it. <|endoftext|> Thank you for the Dunkirk recommendation. I will definitely put that on my list to watch. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm new to this chat format but a big movie fan. <|endoftext|> I am as well! <|endoftext|> Are you more of a Netflix at home movie fan or new releases at the Theater? <|endoftext|> I'm more of a new releases at the cinema fan.. <|endoftext|> Nice. I love new movies also, but it really depends on what the movie is going to be about. What genre or type of movie do you tend to gravitate towards? <|endoftext|> I tend to gravitate towards comedy or horror, I like most things though! Do you have any recommendations in those genres? <|endoftext|> It's no longer in the theater, but Zombieland 2 I think would fit the bill perfectly for a mix of comedy and horror. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one, what's it about? <|endoftext|> It's a sequel to a cult classic film from approximatley 10 years ago. It is set in a zombie apocalypse, but does a great job of making fun of itself as well. Great interaction back and forth between the characters and actors <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great one - would you recommend that I watch the first one before I watch the sequel? <|endoftext|> I would recommend the first one, but I wouldn't say it's required. While the second one could stand on it's own, the first one would be ideal. <|endoftext|> I think I will take you up on that recommendation <|endoftext|> awesome. I really hope you will like this movie. Would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes that would be great! <|endoftext|> Cool. You'll be quoting the movie for weeks <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Anytime. I've enjoyed chatting with you <|endoftext|> I have enjoyed chatting with you as well - I think I might see the first one too.. any recommendations on where to get it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I think watching a trailer on here would be perfect. If you would like, i can make sure to get everything set up. Would that work for you? <|endoftext|> That would be so kind! Thanks a million! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hello! Thank you for helping me.. I am really looking for a movie that my boyfriend and I can watch together. <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movies in mind that you would like to see? <|endoftext|> We both like action movies :) <|endoftext|> Me too I love them. What was the last movie that you two watched? What you liked from that movie? And what you didn't like about it ? <|endoftext|> The last movie we watched was QUOTATION_MARKReady or NotQUOTATION_MARK, which is like a horror movie but kind of funny? Lots of blood and the characters who were the seekers in the movie (they were playing deadly hide and seek) were all idiots, and the girl kept getting away. I really liked how despite it being a QUOTATION_MARKscary movieQUOTATION_MARK, there was comedic relief scattered throughout. I did not like this one seen where the girl who was supposed to be hiding really hurt her hand... it was really graphic and made my stomach hurt a little... <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> Yes, a similar one please :) <|endoftext|> I remember you said you like action movies but it looks like ya'll like horror movies instead. <|endoftext|> We like both, but I would say that Ready or Not had some action moments too. You asked me about the most recent movie we saw and it just happened to be the most recent. I heard Birds of Pray was good though? What do the reviews look like? Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> okay I sure did I'm sorry about that. So would you like to see that movie trailer of Birds of Pray <|endoftext|> Yes please :) <|endoftext|> Can you give me 5 mins before I send it to you I'm having tecnical difficulties. <|endoftext|> Of course :) <|endoftext|> while I'm waiting I want to see what other movies especially comedy do yall like? <|endoftext|> We saw the sequel to Zombieland recently! I really loved the first one and while the second one wasn't *as good*, I still really enjoyed it! Especially the midcredit scene :P <|endoftext|> I hate when that happens it seems like the sequel is always less exciting than the first. <|endoftext|> I think if Zombieland: Double Tap came out first, though, It would be the favorite... Like if the movies were to flip dates our opinions would be different. <|endoftext|> It sounds like they would be if they were. I'm going to attempt to send the movie trailer again. <|endoftext|> Okay cool. I try not to have high hopes with sequels just as I try to separate books from their movies and pretend they are both their own thing. <|endoftext|> They definitely leave a lot out in the movies compared to some books. <|endoftext|> Any luck with the link? <|endoftext|> I can't get birds of prey, I can get warm bodies, ouija, and the duff <|endoftext|> Ooh, I've always wanted to see warm bodies! <|endoftext|> Okay I can definitely pull that one up for you. Thank for being patient and I hope you enjoy the trailer <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Great, I would like something that has lots of action <|endoftext|> What is the latest movie you watched and what did you like about it? <|endoftext|> I saw End game and I loved all the action sequences <|endoftext|> Ok got it. <|endoftext|> I also really like movies with Chris Hemsworth <|endoftext|> What about Avengers <|endoftext|> I've never seen the original Avengers, so that might be a good idea! <|endoftext|> I watched it and it was action packed. <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> So you would like to watch the Avengers movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes please! <|endoftext|> Well that is awesome. <|endoftext|> Do you think I will like it? <|endoftext|> Yes I think you will enjoy it considering you have already seen End Game. <|endoftext|> There isn't a lot of blood though, right? <|endoftext|> No not a lot of blood. <|endoftext|> Ok, I am really looking forward to this recommendation then! <|endoftext|> So you are ready to watch this trailer then? <|endoftext|> yes, please show it to me! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! My name is Melissa, How are you today? <|endoftext|> Im well how are you? <|endoftext|> Im good, thank you for asking. What kind of movies do you like? I love romantic movies. <|endoftext|> I love post apocalyptic movies, and romcoms <|endoftext|> Nice! Have you seen the new Zombieland Movie? <|endoftext|> I have not, is it good? <|endoftext|> I have not but I heard it was good! I might rent it tonight and watch it.

I loved the first one and im wanting to rent it out to have a movie night with the family. What did you love about the movie? <|endoftext|> I really loved the fire spirit character. its a cute little lizard thing. Other than that i like how both girls go off on a separate adventure <|endoftext|> How did you like it compared to the first one? <|endoftext|> Oh! Thats a hard one. I think i might like it more. It does seem geared toward adult like problems, but kids can follow along still <|endoftext|> Im glad they put more adult like problems into it. I haven't seen the 2nd one but I really loved the first one. Well I love anything that has Kristen Bell. <|endoftext|> do yo have any recommendations <|endoftext|> kristen bell <|endoftext|> on movies with her in it? <|endoftext|> I would recommend Bad Moms <|endoftext|> I saw a preview for that one it looks so good! thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> It's really funny, its one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> it was nice chatting. i hope you have a great day <|endoftext|> You too!

Any others like it that you know? <|endoftext|> *books, did you enjoy the lore or the gore more? <|endoftext|> A little of each I suppose. I have only read the hobbit but that was a classic. Any recommendations for me to watch tonight? <|endoftext|> If you want a more family friendly movie with lots of magic and backstory I would recommend the Spiderwick Chronicles <|endoftext|> oh yeah, whats it about? <|endoftext|> it's a family who moves into a house filled with trolls, fairies, and have to protect themselves from them <|endoftext|> hmm, sounds right up my alley. thanks for the recommendation I will check it out.

I am seeking a recommendation on movies that are well made with great female characters. <|endoftext|> You should check out the movie Bad Moms <|endoftext|> Really? What do you like about this movie? <|endoftext|> Its hilarious. it features Mila Kunis, kristen Bell,Kathryn Hahn, Christina Applegate.. <|endoftext|> Those are A-quality movie stars. Thank you! Would you also have a recommendation on drama? I just saw Little Women in the theatres, it was better than I thought. <|endoftext|> I personally love Marley and me featuring Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson <|endoftext|> That one is about a dog? That is great. I do like dogs a lot. Maybe that is a good fit. <|endoftext|> Check it out <|endoftext|> I appreciate the movie has some A-list actors.

Is there a specific genre you like? <|endoftext|> Hi, I like to watch comedy films. What about you? <|endoftext|> I prefer true crime movies, thank you for asking. But comedy is really good, too. Do you have a specific comedian you prefer? <|endoftext|> I like a lot of women comedians with raunchy humor, like Ali Wong <|endoftext|> Raunchy humor huh? That's interesting. Are you a fan of Amy Schumer? I would recommend watching Trainwreck. <|endoftext|> I saw that film and I enjoyed it. Have you seen the Irishman on Netflix? I think you might like it <|endoftext|> I have not seen Irishman, but I'm a fan of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, I'll have to check that out. Would you refer a movie that's on netflix? <|endoftext|> Sure if you want. I also like foreign language comedy films <|endoftext|> Foreign Language. Well, I would recommend High Tension. It's a horror film, so a little bit of me, and a little bit of you. <|endoftext|> Okay, well thanks. I dislike horror films, can you recommend anything else? <|endoftext|> Sure. Have you seen Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. It's a 1988 film staring Antonia Banderas. Its about a series of heightened womanly dilemmas, with a little bit of sexual politics added in <|endoftext|> That sounds great. I haven't seen it. I will check it out. <|endoftext|> Something a little more light hearted is QUOTATION_MARKKlownQUOTATION_MARK its a 2012 film with a little bit of HBO's Curb your Enthusiasm added in. <|endoftext|> Okay, cool. I like Curb Your Enthusiasm. I'll check it out, thanks! <|endoftext|> And if you are looking for something that can pull at your heart strings, I would also recommend My Life as a Dog, from Sweden. Its a coming of age movie, very thought provoking. It goes into childhood wonder and how we have to realize the inevitable as we grow up, such as how to deal with death and heartache. <|endoftext|> Oh, cool, I heard that is good. Have you seen Babylon Berlin on Netflix? I thought it was pretty good. It's about crime in Weimar Germany <|endoftext|> It's in my queue, actually. Thank you for the recommendation! I'll have to watch that! <|endoftext|> Yeah, I thought the design and costumes were really good. Apparently it was one of the most expensive Netflix films ever to produce <|endoftext|> Seriously!? Wow! I just finished the Trials of Gabriel Fernandez, oh my goodness, grab tissues if you want to watch that. <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting as well. That was such a crazy story. Such a sad ending for someone who seemed to have it all. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Bridesmaids staring Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph and a few others? <|endoftext|> Yes, really funny. I love both Kristen Wiig and Maya Rudolph as actresses. I only recently realized Maya's mom was singer Minnie Riperton <|endoftext|> Are you serious!? I had no idea, she has an amazing range! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello! Friend <|endoftext|> Hello, I was wondering if you had any movie recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> i recommended in Avengers movie <|endoftext|> Oh, I like the Marvel movies. I'll have to check that one out. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> you like any  character of this movie ? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I've seen the first Iron Man movie, the Hulk movie, the first Captain America movie, and some of the Spiderman renditions. I need to see Thor though! <|endoftext|> ohh so good <|endoftext|> Do you recommend watching Thor beforehand? <|endoftext|> oh yes <|endoftext|> I will watch them both then! Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> NO, any movie you recommend for me <|endoftext|> Do you like superhero movies? <|endoftext|> yes i like in the movie <|endoftext|> I'd recommend Guardians of the Galaxy. I liked both number one and number two. <|endoftext|> ok super then  your name plaese <|endoftext|> My name is Jake. <|endoftext|> Ok thank you jack bye <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendations, bye! <|endoftext|> what is you coundry <|endoftext|> I live in the United States <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> Hi I'm good, I am looking for a movie to watch this weekend? Do you have any ideas? <|endoftext|> Sure, I am happy to help. What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like comedy, action, and also I like QUOTATION_MARKbiopicQUOTATION_MARK or documentary types of movies <|endoftext|> Ok, and would you like to see a movie at the theater, or one that you can watch at home ? <|endoftext|> I don't mind either setting <|endoftext|> Ok. What's the last movie that you saw at the theater? <|endoftext|> it was Jumanji 2 last year <|endoftext|> Did you like it? <|endoftext|> Yes it was fun, but I don't think it was better than the original movie <|endoftext|> I haven't seen the 2nd one, but I enjoyed the first. Who are some of your favorite actors or actresses? <|endoftext|> I definitely liked Robin Williams in the first Juamji movie, I think I have a movie in mind I would like to watch somebody recommended it to me. It's called QUOTATION_MARKAmundsen <|endoftext|> Hmm, I can't find that movie. What;s it about, I might be able to find something similar <|endoftext|> It's called 'Amundsen' , it's a biopic about the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, of course this is NOT  a Hollyood movie <|endoftext|> It must be rare as my software isn't showing that. Have you seen Everest? It is a pretty good movie based on a true story about people climbing Mt Everest during a horrible blizzard <|endoftext|> It's about the discovery of the South Pole <|endoftext|> Hmm, would you like to watch Everest? It sounds similar, although there is more of a hollywood touch to it <|endoftext|> I don't think so. I don't trust Hollywood in biopics Lol <|endoftext|> How about this? It seems like an interesting biopic. The 25-year-old Danish porn star Denise K. travels back to L.A., where she hopes to make a comeback. <|endoftext|> Hahaha, no thanks. I prefer to stay with my first choice. <|endoftext|> Ok, unfortunately there is no such movie listed in the system <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, can I help you find a movie to watch today? <|endoftext|> yeah <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you enjoy watching? <|endoftext|> Alot of different ones but i like survival horror and comedy movies the best <|endoftext|> Have you seen Zombieland? <|endoftext|> yes i have seen zombieland <|endoftext|> Me, too..one of my favorite horror-comedies. Does that sound like the kind of survival horror-comedy you usually like? <|endoftext|> yes it does <|endoftext|> Then I'd recommend Zombieland: Double Tap <|endoftext|> i accept that recommendation <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> yeah that would be good <|endoftext|> Great! I think we are all set, you will see the movie trailer momentarily. <|endoftext|> sounds good <|endoftext|> Are there any other movies you might enjoy hearing about? <|endoftext|> no thats alright <|endoftext|> Ok, any questions about how they will show you the trailer? <|endoftext|> no thats ok <|endoftext|> okay, I hope you enjoy your movie! <|endoftext|> ok thankyou <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you ? <|endoftext|> Hello I am doing good. <|endoftext|> That's great. Are you looking for a movie to watch? <|endoftext|> Yes, I am looking for a movie recommendation. <|endoftext|> Cool, are you looking for a movie you can watch at home, or one that is at the theater? <|endoftext|> I am looking for a movie to watch at home. <|endoftext|> Ok, what are your favorite types of movies? <|endoftext|> I enjoy drama and thrillers. <|endoftext|> Ok, what are some of your favorite movies? <|endoftext|> Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy <|endoftext|> Ok, and who are some of your favorite actors or actresses? <|endoftext|> Ryan Gosling, George Clooney, Denzel Washington <|endoftext|> Good choices, I think I found a movie that you might enjoy.

After you write back I can subit the movie <|endoftext|> Thank you, I appreciate that. <|endoftext|> No problem!

I think I might have the perfect one for you. What's the most recent superhero movie you've watched? <|endoftext|> I believe the most recent movie I watched was Captain Marvel. <|endoftext|> Nice! One of my best friends loves Marvel movies. Who's your favorite character on there? <|endoftext|> Captain Marvel of course! I loved Gaurdians of the Galaxy much more though, I love Gamora! <|endoftext|> Gamora is definitely a unique character in my opinion! When I learned she was the adopted daughter of Thanos, I instantly knew she would get all the hype! What about in terms of comedy? What is your favorite comedy? <|endoftext|> I agree! My favorite comedy is Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. You can't beat Jim Carrey <|endoftext|> You really can't! He's an icon for sure. I think I might have a great movie for you! <|endoftext|> Okay great! What do you recommend? <|endoftext|> Deadpool. It's a comedy with a superhero vibe to it. VERY funny and the action is tremendous! <|endoftext|> That is a great recommendation, /i will definitely watch it! <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I'm sure you'll love Deadpool, and if you do, then Deadpool 2 is tremendous too! <|endoftext|> Thank you very much! I hope you enjoy the rest of your day! <|endoftext|> You as well! Hope you enjoy the laughs! <|endoftext|> I sure will! <|endoftext|> Wonderful, goodbye! <|endoftext|> Goodbye and happy watching! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to pick a movie trailer for you! what are some types of movies that you like? <|endoftext|> I like comedies. <|endoftext|> oh me too. what are some you've seen recently? <|endoftext|> I watched Anchorman a few days ago. <|endoftext|> Oh I haven't had a chance to see that but I've heard it's good. Did you like it? <|endoftext|> It's one of my favorites. Have you seen Daddy's Home with Mark Wahlberg? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. I like more of Adam Sandler movies <|endoftext|> Any Sandler Sandler movie in particular? <|endoftext|> I've like 50 First dates and Click.It's been a while since i've seen one. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen 50 First Dates. Thank you for the recommendation. I'm going to check it out! <|endoftext|> It's really funny. It's about a girl with amnesia who can only remember one day. It's a rom com <|endoftext|> Great. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> thanks. What is another movie you've seen recently? <|endoftext|> I just saw The Help. <|endoftext|> Oh that was a good movie. Sad though. did you like it? <|endoftext|> It was better than I thought. I thought A Start is Born was really sad. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one yet. Since Disney + launched I've ben mostly revisiting movies from my childhood <|endoftext|> I'm not a big Disney fan. <|endoftext|> Well I hope you like 50 first dates! <|endoftext|> Thanks. I'm looking forward to it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi. Have you any recommendations of a movie with a good plot? <|endoftext|> I watch a ton of movies. Are there certain type of movie genre you prefer or do you like to watch anything? <|endoftext|> I like films with beautiful scenery and in-depth plots. <|endoftext|> Nice!! I just watched a new movie with nice scenery but it was a comedy <|endoftext|> I like some comedies, if they have a good script and an in-depth plot, but mainly I like more realistic storylines inmovies. <|endoftext|> Have you watch Us? The plot is great but not very realistic but it keeps you wondering even at the very end <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen that. It sounds like I'd like it. <|endoftext|> Its a directed by Jordan Peel. He's an amazing comedian but he makes great movies. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I like him a lot. Is the photography good in that movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, the has great scenes. <|endoftext|> Which actors are in this movie? <|endoftext|> Lupita Nyong'o who is also in Black Panther and Elizabeth Moss <|endoftext|> Okay. Those are serious actors. I enjoy their work. <|endoftext|> If you watch Get Out, you will love this movie <|endoftext|> I think I'll watch it. Thanks. <|endoftext|> So would like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I think I would. Do you know how long the actual film is? <|endoftext|> about 2 hours <|endoftext|> Good. It sounds substantial. I like work by serious film makers. <|endoftext|> Great! Glad you like my recommendation. It was nice chatting <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. I am here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hey! How are you doing? I'm looking for something exciting, maybe scary. I just got done watching Nolan's Batman triology, and man i'm hooked! <|endoftext|> I love that trilogy. The best of all the Batman's for sure. Although I grew up with the 1989 Batman's. <|endoftext|> I'm a big fan of the genre as a whole. However, those are the best Batman's. I wonder how Robert Pattinson is going to do as the new batman. I'm not sure how I feel about it <|endoftext|> Me either, but saw some sneak images of the suit and the Batmobile. No cape, bold choice. <|endoftext|> Agreed. It's more of a futuristic Batman beyond type batman. What did you think of Ben in the latest installment? <|endoftext|> I liked him more than I thought I would, but thought the movies weren't as good as they should have been. I think I have a recommendation for a trailer, have you seen The New Mutants trailer? <|endoftext|> I felt the same exact way, you're speaking my language with the Bat. No I have not! It sounds interesting whats it about? <|endoftext|> It's Xmen Horror. You mentioned you might like something a little scary, and this comes out soon. <|endoftext|> No way?!? That sounds intense!! I have actually not seen anything about this and am adamently excited. Wow. <|endoftext|> You should definitely check it out. <|endoftext|> This is amazing! I googled it, as well as saved that link to watch when we are finished. I love mutant stories. <|endoftext|> Me too. Also a big fan of comics, action, horror so it has been fun chatting. <|endoftext|> Agreed! Thank you so much for the movie trailer. I hope you have a great day! <|endoftext|> You also. Is there any other recommendations I can make? <|endoftext|> No I think you knocked it outta the park! <|endoftext|> OK great. Thanks so much and have a terrific day! <|endoftext|> No problem! Do you plan on seeing new mutants? <|endoftext|> I do, actually. I work at a movie theater, so I see almost everything. Will you go and check it out when it comes out? <|endoftext|> Oh for sure. I just watched the trailer. Exactly like you described... xmen horror <|endoftext|> Cool right? I love how they used popular actors from Stranger Things and Game of Thrones. Looks like a lot of fun. <|endoftext|> Yeah, i just finished stranger things. Amazing show. <|endoftext|> It truly is. I have a Starcourt Mall tee shirt :) If there's no other trailers I can recommend I will let you get on with your day. Make it a great one! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, my name is Christine! I'm here to recommend a movie for you <|endoftext|> Oh great! I hope you can recommend a movie for me. <|endoftext|> Do you like to be scared? <|endoftext|> Love to be scared! Horror and Comedy are my two favorite genres. <|endoftext|> Oh, me too! What's the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> That one with John Krasinski where they have to be quiet. I forgot the name! <|endoftext|> The Quiet Place! What did you like about that movie and what did you dislike about it? <|endoftext|> I liked the fx; the monsters were scary, and I really loved the whole premises about the monsters being blind. I also watched that Jordan Peele produced move, I think it was called Us. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> I actually have not seen Us, but I would like to, did you like it? <|endoftext|> It was pretty good, but not as good as The Quiet Place. You should see it. <|endoftext|> You're right, I think I will see it. I think you might like the movie Birdbox. It stars Sandra Bullock and has the creepy vibes that A Quiet Place has. <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of Birdbox before now. What's it about? <|endoftext|> It's pretty crazy. There's an unseen presence that drives people to suicide, so everyone has to keep their eyes closed or walk around with blindfolds on to avoid looking at this QUOTATION_MARKpresence <|endoftext|> Awesome! I'm going to see it. Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> You're welcome! Have a great day! <|endoftext|> YOu too! Bye now <|endoftext|> Is there anything else I can do for you? <|endoftext|> nope, I'm going to the movies now. Bye! <|endoftext|> Ok Great, thanks for suggesting a movie to me as well, I'm going to watch it. Bye <|endoftext|> OH, wait, what about the movie IT? <|endoftext|> Oh I loved IT and IT 2! Did you see them? <|endoftext|> I loved IT but haven't seen IT 2 yet. I'm going to watch it too. Thanks for both recommendations! <|endoftext|> Yes, you should definitely watch it, it has both horror and comedy! and you're welcome! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there <|endoftext|> Hi! I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm wondering if you can help me? I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm looking for a good movie to watch. <|endoftext|> Sure!! What kind of movies are you into? Action, Drama, Romance? <|endoftext|> Well, I like science fiction, action, and psychological thrillers. <|endoftext|> What is the latest movie you have seen? <|endoftext|> Umm, last night I watched \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThor Ragnarok\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd for the millionth time. <|endoftext|> lol you must really like that one! <|endoftext|> Eh, it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds got a few funny lines. I like a funny/sarcastic dialogue, but I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm not really big into slapstick comedies. I prefer the comedy to be spontaneous rather than slapstick. Mind you, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve also read that Uncut Gems is supposed to be good. Have you seen it? <|endoftext|> I have not, but I would recommend you to watch the movie QUOTATION_MARKReplicasQUOTATION_MARK super good flick <|endoftext|> Replicas. Ok, noted! Can you give me a few details about it, please? <|endoftext|> sorry I type that wrong...I means Replicant <|endoftext|> Ok, thank you. That sounds like a great choice, and I will look that up to watch. Thanks and I hope you have a great night! <|endoftext|> Scientists create a genetic clone of a serial killer in order to help catch the killer :) <|endoftext|> Oh awesome! Sounds like a winner! Thank you!!! <|endoftext|> You are very welcome!! <|endoftext|> Do you recommend any other movies as well? I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm at home with small kids, so I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt get out much. Movies are my little mini vacations. <|endoftext|> Yes the Butterfly Effect, but you really need to pay attention to that one so the kids would need to be in bed. <|endoftext|> Ooh, I think I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve seen that one before, but it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds been so long I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll have to watch it again. You\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve got great taste in movies. I accept both of your recommendations! <|endoftext|> Awesome!! I am glad I can help <|endoftext|> Thanks again, and I hope you have a wonderful evening! <|endoftext|> You as well! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, how's it going? <|endoftext|> It's going pretty good. I'm just trying to find a move to watch. <|endoftext|> That's cool, I can help you with that? Is there a specific genre you prefer? <|endoftext|> I love horror and comedy the best. Can you think of any good ones? <|endoftext|> I love horror, that's one of my top 3 genres. Comedy is pretty good too. Are you familiar with the QUOTATION_MARKSawQUOTATION_MARK movies? <|endoftext|> I saw the first one, and it was good. I haven't watched any of the sequels. Are any of them any good? <|endoftext|> Oh yes. The most disturbing one, for me, was QUOTATION_MARKSaw II,QUOTATION_MARK very graphic, very gory. <|endoftext|> Hmmm, but is it creative gore? Tasteful gore? or just gross? <|endoftext|> I would say more on the creative gore side. But you also mentioned that you liked Comedy. Do you have a favorite comedian? <|endoftext|> I like creative gore! Walking Dead fan here! I'm going to watch Saw II. Thanks for the recommendation :) <|endoftext|> You're very welcome <|endoftext|> I'm gonna run now. Hope to see you again later. <|endoftext|> You too, have a wonderful day. <|endoftext|> Oooh, wait, have you seen It2? <|endoftext|> I have not seen it yet, I did get to see the first one. I prefer the original with Tim Curry <|endoftext|> Tim Curry was great in that. Totally creepy. I heard that It2 is really good. Maybe we should watch it? <|endoftext|> That would be great. I hope it follows the same kind of plot line that Stephen King laid out in his books. <|endoftext|> Me too. Stephen King has come up with some great stories over the years. I can't decide between Saw II and It 2 now. You tell me which to choose! <|endoftext|> Because I am a bit partial to the original It, I would suggest starting with Saw II. But why not watch them both? <|endoftext|> I agree with your recommendation to watch Saw II first, and then watch It 2. You're awesome! Cya later. <|endoftext|> Thank you so much, have a good day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there, I'm Mike and I'm here to help you you find a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Cool, thanks Mike. FYI i don't like gory movies <|endoftext|> Well, that takes one genre out of the way. :D Are you looking for something on the other side of the slide? Maybe a romcom or comedy? <|endoftext|> I forgot to mention I also don't like romcom's but I do like to laugh. <|endoftext|> Yeah, romcoms aren't high on my list either, but since I watch *a lot of movies, I dip my toe in every once in a while. Since laughter is the best medicine, what kind of comedy do you prefer? Maybe letting me know what you watched last will give me an idea <|endoftext|> The last comedy I watched was Blockers. But I do like a good zombie movie as well. <|endoftext|> Kinda hard not to like anything that Seth Rogen touches, that guy has a direct line to my funny bone. So, a fellow zombie fan as well...how about a combination of the two?? <|endoftext|> Seth Rogen is pretty funny LoL. I would love a combo movie! What you got? <|endoftext|> I'm going to reach back to one of my go to recommendations to see if you've seen it...QUOTATION_MARKFidoQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I have not but I'm intrigued...is it similar to QUOTATION_MARKshaun of the dead?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Same vein (and I've watched Shaun of the Dead more times that I'm willing to admit). Think Pleasantville style meets Shaun of the Dead. <|endoftext|> Nice! I like it already! As i mentioned I'm not a big gory fan but if it makes me laugh I will let it slide. I will accept your recommendation. I can't wait to watch it. OK, thanks for recommendation. <|endoftext|> It's my pleasure, is there anything else I can recommend for you? <|endoftext|> Nope, I think this is plenty. Thanks again. <|endoftext|> Awesome, have a great evening and enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> : ) <|endoftext|> Good night <|endoftext|> Good night to you too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi! Nice to meet you. I'm looking for a interesting movie trailer <|endoftext|> Nice to meet you too! What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds of movies, but especially sci-fi, horror, drama, and black comedies. <|endoftext|> Okay, that's great! What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Cube Zero <|endoftext|> SO GOOD <|endoftext|> Yeah it was! I also watch Parasites over the weekend. That was really good too. <|endoftext|> So are you looking to stay in the horror category? Or more the drama-type? Or would you want to see something totally different? <|endoftext|> Horror sounds good! <|endoftext|> Have you seen any movies in The Purge series? <|endoftext|> Yes! I have seen the series. The first one with Ethan Hawke was the best, in my opinion. <|endoftext|> I'm a huge fan of Anarchy personally... so I get the feeling you want more QUOTATION_MARKrealisticQUOTATION_MARK type horror <|endoftext|> Yes, I think that's a fair read of me! The more realistic the film, the scarier it is I think! <|endoftext|> Awesome, and same with me... so drama, sci-fi, horror. How about 10 Cloverfield Lane? <|endoftext|> Yes! I love the apocalyptic type horror movies too! I'm a big fan of pandemic & zombie movies. And also movies that depict an upheaval/destruction of civilization as we know it. Super scary and interesting to see depictions of how people might respond. <|endoftext|> Zombies are my jam!! 10 Cloverfield Lane was the first time I was genuinely scared of John Goodman, and to think there may be people like that in this world make it so much more creepy and exciting ha ha. Ok, so now that you threw those choices in, Resident Evil: The Final Chapter? <|endoftext|> John Goodman was great, as always! You know, I've seen some of the Resident Evil franchise, but I don't think I've seen The Final Chapter! I think that's a great recommendation! <|endoftext|> Perfect! I hope you enjoy it (I know you will) <|endoftext|> I bet I will too! Thanks for your help!:) <|endoftext|> Any time! Thank you for chatting! <|endoftext|> Thank you for chatting too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Okay. I am waiting. <|endoftext|> what kind of movies do you like <|endoftext|> I like superhero movies and comedies. I also like a variety of movies light-hearted in nature. <|endoftext|> Cool I like those kind of movies as well. <|endoftext|> Awesome.I don't really get into the horror genre or violent movies. I also stay away from R rated movies. <|endoftext|> I am a really big fan of End Game by Marvel <|endoftext|> That is my favorite of the MCU movies, although I hated the Iron Man and Black Widow deaths. <|endoftext|> Of course, I can't wait for Black Widow to come out in May <|endoftext|> I am looking forward to that as well.I am hopeful they will bring her back in the future some kind of way. <|endoftext|> Anything is possible with Marvel Movies. <|endoftext|> Right. Do you have any movie suggestions right now for trailers I should check out ? <|endoftext|> Black Widow for sure if you have not seen it yet <|endoftext|> I've only seen the early trailers , none since the Super Bowl, not even the one that aired then. <|endoftext|> Also Wonder Women is coming out this year as well. <|endoftext|> Do you also like the DCU movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I am a fan of Batman and wonder woman <|endoftext|> I liked those also. Loved the cheesy tv series of both. LOL. Thought bthe Aquaman movie was awesome!Have you seen the trailer for the new Wonder Woman movie? <|endoftext|> Yes I have would you like to watch it? <|endoftext|> Yes. Sounds like a plan. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you. Looking for a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, do you have any recommendations <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> Prison movies <|endoftext|> What is the last prison movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched shot caller <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> Just with a similar setting <|endoftext|> I would like to recommend Hell or High Water. About a couple of brothers who rob a bank to pay off a loan. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a instructing movie. Is it a older movie <|endoftext|> It is a few years old. 2016 <|endoftext|> Thats still Farley new. Do you know the main actors in it <|endoftext|> Ben Foster and Chris Pine <|endoftext|> Never heard of them. How long is the movie duration <|endoftext|> About an hour and 40 minutes <|endoftext|> Do you know where it was filmed <|endoftext|> In the US not sure of exact location. Movie itself is based in Texas <|endoftext|> Ok. I think that's enough information to know id like to check it out <|endoftext|> That's great. I think you will really like it. <|endoftext|> Ok, its been a pleasure chatting <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help you find a movie to watch! What kinds of movies do you usually like? <|endoftext|> Sounds great. I'm most interested in romantic comedies. <|endoftext|> Those are great, what is your favorite? <|endoftext|> I love Bridesmaids, because it's hilarious. <|endoftext|> I've seen that one, that is a really funny movie. Do you like Kristen Wiig in any of her other movies? <|endoftext|> To be honest, I'm not really familiar with her other movies. But she was really funny in Bridesmaids. I liked the scene where she's attending her friend's wedding dress fitting because it really made me laugh. It felt like I could really relate. <|endoftext|> That's awesome; what was the last romantic comedy you saw? <|endoftext|> Hmm, I have to think about that. I remember seeing Always Be My Maybe recently. I really liked that movie because the main actor and actress were Asian American like me. I felt like it was one of the few breakout movies for Asian actors. <|endoftext|> That's good to know, is that something you'd like to see more of in movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I am very interested in seeing more diverse casts and more casts with Asian Americans specifically. We are usually completely absent from the big screen. So I am looking for a recommendation for a romantic comedy movie with Asian American characters. <|endoftext|> I think you'd probably like this movie, it features two Asian American leads and is a romantic comedy that is supposed to be pretty good. <|endoftext|> Which movie are you referring to? <|endoftext|> Oops, I thought you could see it. I'm talking about QUOTATION_MARKAlways Be My MaybeQUOTATION_MARK, it is a Netflix movie featuring Ali Wong and Randall Park. <|endoftext|> I'd like another recommendation, since I just told you that I've seen that movie recently <|endoftext|> Oh, sorry about that. I will pick something else. I'm assuming you've seen Crazy Rich Asians since it was so popular. Have you seen the Big Sick? <|endoftext|> I haven't. That doesn't have Asian characters but I've heard good things about the Big Sick. I accept this recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great, I think the comedy in there is really good and sort of like what you see in Bridesmaids <|endoftext|> Okay, I will definitely check that out. Thank you so much. <|endoftext|> You are very welcome <|endoftext|> Have a good day! I appreciate your help and recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi, How are you? What's your favorite genre of movies? <|endoftext|> I really like comedies, how about you? <|endoftext|> Comedies is my seconed favorite. You can enjoy them any time a day. I prefer Horror movies! I love the anticipation. do you prefer to watch comedies alone or with a group of people? <|endoftext|> Usually a group, but would you be interested in a movie suggestion? <|endoftext|> Yes I would appreciate that! What do you have in mind? <|endoftext|> Well what was the last horror movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Bye Bye Man! You can stream it through netflix, it will keep you on your toes for sure! What comedy would you recommend? <|endoftext|> Do you like a clean comedy or kinda raunchy? <|endoftext|> Both, but Raunchy comedies have a direct line to my funny bone. <|endoftext|> ,Got It,  I would check out the Hangover then! <|endoftext|> That's a great recommendation! I've heard that movie was hilarious. Thanks for chatting with me and thank you agai nfor the recommendation!! Have a good day! <|endoftext|> No worries, I hope you enjoy this trailer. <|endoftext|> Yes, I will definently view it today, I hope you don't get too scared of the bye bye man! (Just Joking) <|endoftext|> I will check it out, did you watch it alone? <|endoftext|> No! Never! I wouldn't get any sleep if I did that. My mother is the queen of watching horror movies alone. I'm not sure how she does it. It might add to the scary factor though! <|endoftext|> Oh that is awesome that your mom enjoys them, I love watching movies with family <|endoftext|> Yes it's always a great memory to have a movie night with the family! <|endoftext|> Are you interested in any other movies? <|endoftext|> Action! I've been rewatching the Rambo series! It's really entertaining. What do you recommend? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, do you consider yourself a fan of movies? <|endoftext|> I do consider myself a fan of movies <|endoftext|> What genre is your go to when seeking out new movies? <|endoftext|> horror is my favorite genre <|endoftext|> What was the last horror movie you saw? <|endoftext|> The last one I saw in the theater was It: Chapter 2. I've watched some older ones at home more recently. <|endoftext|> Did you like It Chapter 2 or do you prefer the older ones? <|endoftext|> I like both old and new, but I really enjoyed It: Chapter 2 <|endoftext|> What did you like about It? Characters, villian, plot? I know I liked the characters a lot. <|endoftext|> I really liked the characters. I'm a big fan of this new Pennywise, and the kids/adults were perfectly cast. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the original Poltergeist from 1982. <|endoftext|> I have seen that one. <|endoftext|> Oh good, I really like that one but unlike the new It movies, Poltergeist' remake was not good in my opinion. Have you seen Hereditary? Came out in 2018. <|endoftext|> I didn't like the Poltergeist remake either. I found the whole thing boring. I haven't seen Hereditary yet. I've been meaning to. That is a great recommendation. I accept it. <|endoftext|> Hereditary was great. Not big names like It, but still the suspense needed to make the plot wild. I also recommend the directors newest movie Midsommar. <|endoftext|> Another one I've been meaning to watch. I'll take that recommendation too! <|endoftext|> I would say Hereditary is more like Poltergeist. Midsommar is like The Wicker Man <|endoftext|> I liked the original Wicker Man. The newer one was kind of funny with the overacting lol <|endoftext|> Definitely the older on from 70s, not the Nic Cage one, as fun as it is. <|endoftext|> The original had those fun songs too...giving it an added bonus <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello. What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I love dramatic indie movies, as well as super action packed movies <|endoftext|> that's interesting. Would you prefer a dramatib indie movie at the moment or do you prefer an action packed movie? <|endoftext|> I would definitely enjoy a dramatic indie movie for this dreary cold day <|endoftext|> Pulp Fiction is my all time favorite dramatic Indie movie. Have you even watched Pulp Fiction? <|endoftext|> YES i love pulp fiction. I love all Quentin Tarantino films <|endoftext|> Yes!!! John Travolta and Samuel Jackson are absolutely amazing, I've watched this movie a gazillion times and find something different each time that I overlooked before.

I'll check out a preview or something. Thanks. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi my name is Brianna.

Personally I loved the newest Angry Birds movie! It had my whole family laughing. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that movie yet sounds fun from the way you described it <|endoftext|> It's similar to Sonic, it's a cartoon and is all age friendly! Also full of comedy and action. <|endoftext|> I've also enjoyed playing the games from the franchise, perhaps I'll give it a shot. <|endoftext|> Would you like anymore options? <|endoftext|> I will try the angry birds movie first. Thanks for your reccomendation! <|endoftext|> No problem! I hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|> I will, oh and do you know if the movie is still playing? <|endoftext|> Not in theaters.

I love true crime and crime related or mystery action movies. <|endoftext|> I think I know a movie you would enjoy. It's called Inception, with Leonardo DiCaprio. It's a mystery/thriller. Would you like to watch the trailer now? <|endoftext|> Sure, but I've already seen that movie. <|endoftext|> Let's try to find something else, then.

Let's first watch the Inception trailer, and then we will find a true crime trailer for you. <|endoftext|> Okay, that sounds goo. <|endoftext|> Here's an intriguing true crime story. It's called QUOTATION_MARKDarkQUOTATION_MARK, about a murder investigation of a slain businessman. Lots of twists and turns. <|endoftext|> That sounds very interesting. <|endoftext|> I find that mysteries are most engaging when the story behind them is true. Do you agree? <|endoftext|> Yeah, I think that can be true. But most of the time it seems like the creators have to embellish or change things at least a little bit to QUOTATION_MARKsuit the screenQUOTATION_MARK. <|endoftext|> True; sometimes we don't really know exactly what happened, so the director has to fill in the blanks. <|endoftext|> So this movie QUOTATION_MARKdarkQUOTATION_MARK is on Netflix?:) <|endoftext|> Yes, it's from 2016, so it is available on several streaming services. <|endoftext|> WOW. Dark looks Really Scary! LOL! <|endoftext|> Yes. Would you ever expect to see Jim Carrey in this type of movie? <|endoftext|> Well, I'm not surprised. He has done a lot of dramatic acting. And actually, I think his dramatic acting is better. I was never a big Ace Ventura fan, lol <|endoftext|> Let's see how he does in this one. Are you ready to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I am! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> How's it going?

I'll get that going for you! <|endoftext|> great thanks so much <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! are you a fan of Sci-Fi movies? <|endoftext|> definately <|endoftext|> Do you like action oriented sci-fi, or do you prefer slower, more cerebral sci-fi movies? <|endoftext|> more action than cerebral <|endoftext|> What was the last sci-fi flick you watched? <|endoftext|> Star trek into darkness <|endoftext|> did you like it? <|endoftext|> yes i did <|endoftext|> Have you seen Star Trek: The Wrath of Khan? <|endoftext|> yes i have <|endoftext|> Which one did you like better? <|endoftext|> wrath of Kahn he was more menacing, into darkness he just seemed angry, i would say wrath of Kahn <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the latest Ghostbusters movie? <|endoftext|> the 2016 movie, no, but i will likely watch the one that comes out this year <|endoftext|> Me too, but the 2016 one wasn't as bad as they said it was. The ghosts alone are worth a viewing. <|endoftext|> it was not a terrible movie in itself, but as a ghostbusters movie it sucked <|endoftext|> Have you seen Sorry to Bother You? <|endoftext|> no i have not <|endoftext|> I highly recommend that one. The trailers paint it up as something its not. Quite surprising in the end. <|endoftext|> ill probably check it out <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how're you today? <|endoftext|> Hi, I am good just looking for a good ghost movie to watch. <|endoftext|> That's awesome, I sometimes enjoy a good ghost movie. Have you watched any recently that you've enjoyed? <|endoftext|> Well I have seen the grudge, la llorona, fantasy Island, and the ring. <|endoftext|> Great options! I Saw the grudge and found it to be interesting, better than I thought I would enjoy. <|endoftext|> Do you happen to know any good ghost movie I could watch? <|endoftext|> Yes,the Turning would be a good option because it is a fairly recent movie release <|endoftext|> Oh! I haven't seen that one yet I will look forward to watching it. Is there any trailer for it? <|endoftext|> Yes, there is a trailer on Youtube if you are interested in checking it out <|endoftext|> Thank You will do! <|endoftext|> You're welcome, hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> By Any chance do you happen to know any good Japanese horror movie? <|endoftext|> I'm not well versed on that genre, I wouldn't know any. I think a simple google search can give you a few good options. <|endoftext|> Ah ok any other good horrors that you can recommend after I am done with the turning? <|endoftext|> I enjoyed IT( both chapter 1 and 2), US was also pretty good. There's Ready or Not, Annabelle comes Home and Midsommar that received decent reviews but I haven''t watched yet. <|endoftext|> Great I am making a list of movies to watch. I usually don't watch action movies but would u recommend a good mystery action. <|endoftext|> I love action movies, I would say the Bad Boys for Life is great! I think it's still in theaters if you want to watch it. Also, the The John Wick franchise is interesting, there is 21 Bridges which I liked. And also Black and Blue <|endoftext|> I have not seen 21 Bridges or Black and Blue. <|endoftext|> Those two are out for renting/streaming, I didnt think I would like them but ended up enjoying them. There is also The Gemini Man but I havent watched that one yet! <|endoftext|> I will look into watching them. Thank you so much hopefully I find good trailers to see which to watch first. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> i am looking forward to hearing your recommendations <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see <|endoftext|> I like action movies <|endoftext|> What is the last movie that you watched? Was it an action movie? <|endoftext|> kind of. It was Fools Gold. <|endoftext|> What did you like about the movie?

I like movies like Speed. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Ford Vs. Ferrari? It has actors like Christian Bale and Matt Damon. <|endoftext|> no - i have been thinking about seeing that. <|endoftext|> I think you would like it. It has a lot of action and drama. <|endoftext|> I actually have no idea what the movie is about <|endoftext|> It's about racers who need to build a revolutionary car for Ford Motor Co., which they plan to race the against cars of Enzo Ferrari. Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. I have a few movies that I think you may be interested in. What movies are you into? <|endoftext|> Hi, I really enjoy adult comedies, not infantile comedies. I also like QUOTATION_MARKchick flicksQUOTATION_MARK if done tastefully. And action movies, but not ones showing alot of bloody killing. <|endoftext|> Great to hear. I see we have similar tastes in movies. What was the last movie you watched recently? <|endoftext|> I watched an oldie but goodie -- The Way We Were -- with Streisand and Redford <|endoftext|> Yes they are both great actors. Are you in the mood for a action movie <|endoftext|> That would be fun. I haven't watched one in a bit. What do you have in mind? <|endoftext|> Do you have any particular actors you enjoy watching in action films? <|endoftext|> Chris Pratt is a favorite. <|endoftext|> Do you like fast an furious or mission impossible movies? I liked Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy <|endoftext|> Yes! He was really good in that. And funny. I like his comedic talent. <|endoftext|> I reccomend Guardians of the Galaxy 2 <|endoftext|> Actually I've seen that movie. But it's been awhile. That would make a good one for tonight. I know what to expect. I like it and will watch later. Thanks. <|endoftext|> Since you have already seen that. I would try and watch one more current. not action but a different genre <|endoftext|> No thanks. The more I think about it, the more I want to watch it again. It's a fun movie and I want fun tonight. Thanks. <|endoftext|> That is great. I am glad. Don't you just love groot <|endoftext|> He is adorable. But I really like Pratt's character the best. He's such a natural. <|endoftext|> He does an excellent job in the movie. He is such a talent. <|endoftext|> I always expect a good movie when he's in it. He chooses wisely. <|endoftext|> what is you favorite movie with Chris anyway? <|endoftext|> Oooooh, that's a tough one. But I think Jurassic World is my favorite so far. I saw it on the big screen. The intensity of the dinosaurs and his drama with the female lead kept everyone involved. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, what kind of movies are you interested in? <|endoftext|> Hello! I am interested in horror and drama, how about you? <|endoftext|> That's a great genre! What are some of your favorite titles? <|endoftext|> There is a trailer out about a part two of QUOTATION_MARKQuiet Place llQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Really? I'd be interested in that one. The first was great. If you like movie like QUOTATION_MARKA Quiet PlaceQUOTATION_MARK then I can definitely make some recommendations. <|endoftext|> Yes please! I would like that. <|endoftext|> What did you like about A Quiet Place? <|endoftext|> I did like the fact about staying quiet while trying to live among these creatures. <|endoftext|> OKay let's find some trailers similar to that. <|endoftext|> Please find some suitable trailers for me. <|endoftext|> Have you seen 10 Cloverfield Lane? <|endoftext|> Yes I have! And loved that movie. <|endoftext|> That would be my top pick, but since you've seen it... how about QUOTATION_MARKAnnihilationQUOTATION_MARK? with Natalie Portman? <|endoftext|> I have not seen QUOTATION_MARKAnnihilationQUOTATION_MARK!, would you recommend this movie? <|endoftext|> I would. It's similar to A Quiet Place but different enough to be interesting so you dont feel like youre watching the same movie again. It's less focused on the QUOTATION_MARKquietQUOTATION_MARK elements but features a good bit of mysterious fantasy creatures and a general sci-fi mystery plot <|endoftext|> I do accept this recommendation and can not wait to see. Thank you very much! <|endoftext|> You'll like it. But if I may make another suggestion. Don't Breathe is also great within this genre. This title would be more of a suspenseful, quiet, with lots of scares and a less involved plot. <|endoftext|> I can view the first recommendation and look into this other QUOTATION_MARKDon't BreatheQUOTATION_MARK as the next movie to watch. Thank you so much! <|endoftext|> You're welcome. Good luck! <|endoftext|> Have a good day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you doing?! <|endoftext|> hey how are u today? <|endoftext|> doing well thanks! DO you know what  kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I'm a big comedy buff! I can do a good comedy anytime :) <|endoftext|> I love comedies too! Have you seen Horrible bosses? It cracks me up everytime! <|endoftext|> Omg! one of my Favs! Jennifer Anderson was hilarious! I believe that was the 1st time i saw her play a part like that. <|endoftext|> I agree! Jamie Foxx and Jason Bateman are great actors too in it! I feel so bad for Jennifer Anistons emplyee! lol <|endoftext|> Yessss! out of all the guys, she liked the sweet one with the fiance. And as for Jason Bateman, i've seen everything he been in. <|endoftext|> yes! I know you said you love a good comedy! so would you like to watch the horrible bosses trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I definitely would! Thanks for that recommendation. <|endoftext|> of course! <|endoftext|> did you have anything else maybe you could recommend? <|endoftext|> i know you said you love jason bateman! have you ever seen couples retreat? <|endoftext|> Of Course i have! that was another great 1! Vince Von is another 1 i've watched all his stuff. <|endoftext|> Oh Vince vaugh is another great actor! Him and Jennifer aniston did the break up together! I feel like it started off funny and then it got serious! its another great movie though! <|endoftext|> Agreed, got a little down in the end! But alright, lets see if you can give me 1 i haven't seen yet, lol <|endoftext|> since you like comedies do you like any adam sandler movies? <|endoftext|> U r my type of movie buff! Ive been watching Adam since he was on SNL. I even had his comedy tape from back in the days . <|endoftext|> oh my goodness i hope i can recommend one you havent seen! have you seen blended? its a great movie with drew barrymoore! <|endoftext|> I have literally watched Every single thing Adam has touched <|endoftext|> haha well would you like to watch the blended trailer? <|endoftext|> yes that would be great <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, I'm Janette how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Hi Janette! I am well, how are you? <|endoftext|> What are you up to? <|endoftext|> Trying to figure out a movie to watch. Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Sure, what was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched Blade Runner last night, but it was old and sort of boring. <|endoftext|> Is the only thing you didnt like about it is that it was old? <|endoftext|> It also felt slow paced <|endoftext|> Oh okay, maybe something more fast paced and newer. I recently saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi. I LOVED it. I like fast paced movies as well. You should watch it. Want to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah sure! Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> No problem. <|endoftext|> Actually, I already saw that trailer. I'm thinking of a comedy, any recommendations for that? <|endoftext|> So a fast paced new comedy? Hmm... have you seen Booksmart? That movie came out last year and it was so hilarious. <|endoftext|> I have not seen that yet! When did that come out? <|endoftext|> It came out in 2019 in the summer. <|endoftext|> Okay. What did you like about it? <|endoftext|> So many good jokes. They are 2 highschool girls that realize they never had fun in high school so they cram it in to one night and go on this insane adventure filled with parties, being arrested, dancing, and each kissing people they have liked throughout high school. They are best friends that have such hilarious commentary. <|endoftext|> Is it like the movie Superbad? <|endoftext|> Totally but I think it is funnier. <|endoftext|> Amazing! I'll have to check that out. Thanks! <|endoftext|> No problem at all, have fun! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> I am asking for a recommendation <|endoftext|> great! what kind of movies do you like to watch? is there a specific genre? <|endoftext|> I like horror movies, comedy, anything really! I'm in the mood for comedy today. <|endoftext|> interesting, do you remember the last comedy movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched the other guys last <|endoftext|> Ah, Dwayne Johnson was in that I think. I recently watched Central Intelligence, another comedy movie he was in! I found it hilarious, plus Kevin Hart is in it as well. <|endoftext|> Oh I don't think I've seen Central Intelligence! I think that would be a great movie to watch. I love Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson they're really funny <|endoftext|> Yes they are a hilarious pair. As the title suggests, it's a comedic take on the central intelligence agency. The trailer mixed action and comedy and really made me want to watch it. <|endoftext|> Thank you for your recommendation! I will accept your recommendation and watch the movie tonight! <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure I will see the trailer <|endoftext|> I have a good feeling that you will enjoy it! It even gave me an adrenaline rush when I saw it. <|endoftext|> That sounds really good, is it like an action movie? <|endoftext|> It's a mix of action and comedy actually! There's the general feel of an action movie with comedic relief sprinkled in throughout. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great mix!! I'm excited to watch it and receive the same adrenaline rush! <|endoftext|> It's one of those movies that you don't get tired of watching, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thank you! If you like comedy movies you should watch Ride Along <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting as well, I've never heard of it <|endoftext|> Kevin Hart is in it as well! Thank you for your recommendation, I will watch it tonight! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! I would like to help you with any movie trailer recommendations! <|endoftext|> awesome. any ideas <|endoftext|> I have a few. What type of movies have you watched in the last couple months? <|endoftext|> jojo rabbit, knives out, shadow <|endoftext|> I would first recommend Gemini Man with Will Smith. Awesome movie with plenty of action but also some plot twists that lead to an interesting plot. <|endoftext|> I have not seen that movie yet. I've thought of watching it maybe <|endoftext|> It highly recommend it. Smith rarely disappoints. Another one would be Once Upon a Time in Hollywood if you like Tarantino movies or Ford vs Ferrari for a combination historical/suspense movie. <|endoftext|> I will definitely watch it soon then. Tarantino's movies are the best <|endoftext|> Excellent. Enjoy! Good chatting with you. <|endoftext|> good bye <|endoftext|> I have sent a couple of those movie trailers to you for you to view <|endoftext|> I will try to view them. buy trailers sometimes giveaway the plot <|endoftext|> They occasionally do. From what I remember about the Gemini Man trailer is that it only gives away plot points that are already evident on the movie cover. There are enough other twists hidden in the movie. <|endoftext|> my favorite movie of will smith is Men in black. but he also does serious movies also. <|endoftext|> This will in line with his normal level of acting. Throwing in suttle humor while not losing the mood of the scene. <|endoftext|> I'm just glad he is still in movies <|endoftext|> I agree. It's fun to see long time actors also evolve into other roles. Will Smith in The Fresh Prince of BelAir to his movie roles now are night and day but it is still authentically him. <|endoftext|> I forgot Gemini Man was himself against himself from the trailer. after rewatching it <|endoftext|> Yep, pretty interesting premise. <|endoftext|> sort of like predestination, but not time travel i assume <|endoftext|> No time travel. It has more of a realistic vibe. Hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was frozen at home with my babies. <|endoftext|> Nice! Are you looking for something you can watch with your kids? <|endoftext|> I would love that. I love to sit with my kids and watch movies that relate to both of us. <|endoftext|> How old are your kids? <|endoftext|> They are all younger than 4. <|endoftext|> Got it! <|endoftext|> That is perfect. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> I have some friends who have seen Onward, and they say it is a pretty cute movie. <|endoftext|> That is awesome! I accept your recommendation. I have been wanting to watch that. <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I'm glad you would be interested in watching this movie trailer. <|endoftext|> I really am. Thank you for your help <|endoftext|> You are quite welcome! I hope you & your family are doing well in this crazy time we're in right now! <|endoftext|> We are. It is crazy and a good movie would really brighten the mood. <|endoftext|> Amen to that :) <|endoftext|> I hope you and your family are doing well as well. <|endoftext|> Thank you!

I am looking for a movie recommendation. Perhaps you know of a good trailer I could watch? <|endoftext|> Yes, I can help. What is the last movie you have seen in the movie thearter. <|endoftext|> The last movie that I saw in the theater was Frozen 2 with my daughter. But I am looking for something to watch on my own. I really enjoy historical fiction. <|endoftext|> For the historical fiction do you like a violent or more of a story focused movie. <|endoftext|> I can tolerate some violent, but I like human interest stories more. <|endoftext|> Me too! What time period or era do you like the most. <|endoftext|> I really enjoy anything from about the 1600's to now. <|endoftext|> Are you looking for a newer movie or an older released movie. <|endoftext|> Either one is fine with me. <|endoftext|> Have you very heard of the move QUOTATION_MARKOutlanderQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> No, I have not. <|endoftext|> The movie is about a time traveling nurse. Would you like me to tell you more. <|endoftext|> Well that certainly sounds interesting. I would like to watch that. <|endoftext|> There is also my favorite movie Inglorious Basterds. <|endoftext|> I have seen that one. I enjoyed it. <|endoftext|> So would you like to find a movie with a little more action? <|endoftext|> No. I think I accept your recommendation of Outlander. <|endoftext|> Alright sounds good do you need help with anything else? <|endoftext|> No, that will be all.

I am well, how are you? <|endoftext|> I am good! What is your fav movie genre <|endoftext|> I really like comedies but thrillers with crazy endings or twists are my favorite. Do you have any recommendations?? <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, if you like comedies have you seen 21 jump street? And for thrillers, ever heard of QUOTATION_MARKThe devilQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> I have seen 21 Jump Street. It was really funny and I love ice cubes character in the movie. I have never heard of the devil. Do you have any details about the movie? <|endoftext|> So the movie is about a group of people where they all have a secret past. They do not know each other, but they have a past that is tied all together somehow. One of them i sthe devil who shows up to give them their punishment. Most skin crawling movie i have ever seen! <|endoftext|> Wow that sounds amazing! That is exactly the type of movie I usually go for. I am definitely going to check that out. <|endoftext|> Awesome. I think youll like it because I saw it on Netflix. RARELY is anything thriller or scary decent on netflix, so i always recommend it <|endoftext|> That is awesome that it is on Netflix. The only decent thrillers on Netflix I have seen are foreign shows or movies with subtitles and sometimes they are hard to get through. <|endoftext|> Yes I agree! I am sure you have heard of the Zodiac. The movie is on Netflix as well, and that one is also a solid piece. <|endoftext|> Yes I have seen the Zodiac. That is another good one! I am going to go find The Devil and watch that tonight. Thanks for your help! <|endoftext|> Oh awesome! I am glad to have helped! <|endoftext|> Do you know when the devil was released? <|endoftext|> Back in 2010! <|endoftext|> Wow, I just looked it up and M Night directed it so it will definitely be interesting haha. <|endoftext|> AND it was awarded 2 nominations. i hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Thats not bad. I am not a fan of all of his stuff but I really like his new show out on Apple + called Servant <|endoftext|> Oh i havent heard of that one. I have never been disappointed though with anything from him. <|endoftext|> You will like it for sure if you have a chance to check it out. <|endoftext|> I will for sure. Thank you for a rec as well! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Can I help you find a movie? <|endoftext|> Please! I'm a huge fan of horror films, but prefer more dread than gore. Do you have any suggestions? <|endoftext|> What is your favorite horror film? <|endoftext|> My favorite horror film would probably be The Shining. It's a unique story that keeps the viewer on edge the entire time. I love that over jump scares and senseless gore. <|endoftext|> Ok, awesome. Are you looking for something like an older classic or maybe something newer? <|endoftext|> Preferably something modern as I've seen most of the classic horror films numerous times already. <|endoftext|> It's hard to beat the classics. I love the suspense in Hitchcock movies the best. <|endoftext|> Agreed! He was truly a master of suspense that only a select few have come close to replicating  (Shyamalan, Kubrick, Flanagan, etc.). You know of any newer films that could pass as QUOTATION_MARKHitchcock-ianQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> I will do my best to find something you haven't seen! <|endoftext|> Thank you! If it helps, something that deals more with dread than anything else. Nothing tops feeling dread throughout an entire film! <|endoftext|> How did you feel about Split from M. Night? Did you find it too slow, or did that have the dread you're looking for? <|endoftext|> I actually haven't seen that one yet. I also did not know Night made that one. Can you tell me a little bit of what it's about? <|endoftext|> It's one of my favorites he's done so far. James McAvoy does an mind blowingly good job at playing I think 23 different personalities in the film. <|endoftext|> 23 personalities! That sounds interesting. Without giving too much away, is he like a villain in the film? He's truly a talented actor but I've never seen him play a QUOTATION_MARKbad guyQUOTATION_MARK before. <|endoftext|> He's *mostly* the bad guy. The film is about a group of girls that are abducted and held hostage by a person with multiple personalities. One personality in particular - The Beast - has a plan for them. Some of the personalities side with The Beast, and some do not. It is the second film in the Unbreakable series, but different in style for sure. You don't need to know anything about Unbreakable to see Split, though. <|endoftext|> Wow! That sounds like a psychological mind twist and definitely vintage Shyamalan. I will accept the recommendation and give it a watch! It sounds like it's right up my alley and deals more with dread and suspense. Thank you kindly! <|endoftext|> You're welcome! <|endoftext|> Can you tell me the rating and why it received the rating? <|endoftext|> It has a 7.3 on IMDB, with 19 nominations and 8 awards. Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> I would love to see the trailer! And that rating is perfect for me as trolls like to give great movies bad ratings so anything above a 6 must truly be great! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. How are you? <|endoftext|> Hello! I am good- yourself? <|endoftext|> Good.

He is neck deep in debt and people are always after him trying to get their money back but my boy Adam Sandler spends more money on gambling risking his life along with his family's future. Very tense movie man, keeps you on the edge the whole time. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdSo would you like to watch this movie trailer?\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd <|endoftext|> What year was it made? <|endoftext|> end of 2019, there was this big fuss about how it got snubbed for oscar <|endoftext|> Do you have any recommendations for space movies? <|endoftext|> First Man, my favorite space movie of all time.

LOL <|endoftext|> What about Onward? Did you like it better? <|endoftext|> I thought it was good! That movie had alot of heart. Have you seen it yet? <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it yet, but I know Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are in it, so I'm definitely going to see it soon. <|endoftext|> You should see it!

I hear that you are looking for movie recommendations! What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like true story movies about people who accomplished things to make the world a better place <|endoftext|> So like an inspirational biography of sorts? Have you seen A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood yet? It stars Tom Hanks and I absolutely adored it. I definitely think that Mr. Rogers is someone who made the world a better place. <|endoftext|> No I haven\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt seen that movie but it sounds interesting, The last movie I have seen was Hacksaw Ridge. It was a true story about a man for fought without a weapon I believe during Vietnam. It was a great movie I would recommend seeing. <|endoftext|> Nice! I have not heard of it before; I have to add it to my list--I am not super familiar with the wartime genre. However, my friend and I watched Letters from Iwo Jima together a couple of years ago. It's a World War II film, but it portrays the Battle of Iwo Jima from the perspective of two Japanese soldiers. It is in Japanese (I am a native English speaker) so be forewarned you may have to watch it with subtitles! <|endoftext|> Cool. Thank you for the recommendation. I will have to watch that movie. Hopefully you will take my recommendation also. Thank you. <|endoftext|> You are welcome! I'll definitely check out Hacksaw Ridge--it sounds like something my dad and I can watch together! <|endoftext|> Thank you are. Take care. <|endoftext|> You too! Enjoy the recommendation! <|endoftext|> I will. Same too. <|endoftext|> Do you like the trailer? I forgot to mention that its also critically acclaimed. <|endoftext|> Yes. You will like the Trailer for Hacksaw Ridge. <|endoftext|> Good! There's also a companion film called Flags of Our Fathers which was film at the same time. <|endoftext|> I will have to check out that movie also. Hacksaw Ridge was also up for Oscar. <|endoftext|> Cool! It might make me seem a bit elitist but I do like to go for movies that have good reviews (most of the time). <|endoftext|> Ok. Glad we agree on each other\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds recommendations. Thanks again. Take care <|endoftext|> Very welcome! <|endoftext|> You are so welcome. My pleasure <|endoftext|> Also, if you like those do check out the Sands of Iwo Jima (it's an oldie, but a goodie!) <|endoftext|> Cool. Sounds good <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today? I'm here to help you with finding a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> I'm doing wonderfully, thank you. Great! I'm excited to see which movie trailer you select. <|endoftext|> Awesome! What kind of movies do you enjoy the most? <|endoftext|> Movies with an inspiring storyline and main character. <|endoftext|> Those do seem to be the best kinds of movies. What is the last movie you watched that made you experince those attributes? <|endoftext|> The Martian was great <|endoftext|> I've seen that one, definitely a good movie. Would you prefer a movie with a similar story or go with something different? <|endoftext|> Either or sounds good. I'm just in the mood for a movie. <|endoftext|> A movie along the same theme would be Gravity with Sandra Bullock. It's a good and suspensful movie. <|endoftext|> Sounds good. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> Very, good. Hope you enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> I got it <|endoftext|> Oh I see. <|endoftext|> Have a great day! <|endoftext|> Yep, you as well. <|endoftext|> Don't forget the popcorn! <|endoftext|> Hrm. Not a bad idea. <|endoftext|> Extra butter, it's the best <|endoftext|> I could add some cheese to match the movie! <|endoftext|> Sounds great <|endoftext|> Alrighty, I have to leave now. It was nice chatting with you, good bye! <|endoftext|> Ok, take care <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi! Im looking for a movie trailer. I like comedy and family movies. <|endoftext|> I can't wait to give you some recommendations. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Frozen 2 was the last one I watched <|endoftext|> Oh wow! That's the last movie I watched too. I was glad Disney+ released it early. I'm guessing you've seen most of the recent Disney releases, correct? <|endoftext|> Absolutely! I love Disney movies! Pets 2 was a good one too! <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one yet. You may have turned me on to a new movie :) Are you looking for a movie to watch with kids? Are you looking for something similar to Frozen 2? <|endoftext|> It was a really cute movie! My kids loved it! Yes! My kids and I do movies all weekend. <|endoftext|> That's so nice! I loved movie nights growing up. Have you heard of the movie Troop Zero on Amazon Prime? <|endoftext|> No I haven't heard of that one! <|endoftext|> I haven't watched that one yet, but I just added it to my Watchlist. It has Viola Davis, Jim Gaffigan and Allison Janney in it. A great cast. If you're looking for a cartoon though, I think I would recommend Spies In Disguise. Did you catch that one yet? <|endoftext|> No I haven't caught that one yet either! Troop zero is definitely going on my watch list! Cartoon is more for my family! My children are under 10 years old. I'll have to check out Spies in Disguise. I'm over watching Tangled and Zootopia over and over <|endoftext|> Haha I can only imagine! (Also a strong recommendation for when the kids aren't around is Knives Out. It's my top movie for the year.) Would you like to watch the trailer for Spies in Disguise? <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendations! I would love to watch the trailer for Spies in Disguise! <|endoftext|> Awesome! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Thanks! I'm sure we will! Have you checked out Deadpool 2? <|endoftext|> Yes! What a hilarious movie. Lol now that one I would not recommend with the kids around <|endoftext|> No if course not! I haven't had a chance to check it out but the first one was awesome. <|endoftext|> I don't think it was as funny as the first, but it's hard to compete. I watched another pretty funny movie called Good Boys that came out last year that was so funny. The majority of the cast are kids but its rated R. My goodness it was hilarious. <|endoftext|> Definitely checking that one out as well! I definitely accept all of your movie recommendations! You have a great taste in movies! Thanks <|endoftext|> Thanks so much! Have a great week with the family it was a pleasure chatting with you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you?

Yes, I like action movies! <|endoftext|> Im glad there is a lot of time to watch movies now wit coronavirus running around, what other genre do you like? <|endoftext|> Other than action, I like romcoms a lot.

What about action and sci-fi movies excites you? <|endoftext|> Yeah those two go together quite well <|endoftext|> I totally agree.

I'm looking up some trailers for you now. Are you into horror movies as well? <|endoftext|> Na horrors scare me a lot. I like thrillers though. <|endoftext|> Okay. I think that you will really like the trailer for 10 Cloverfield Lane. It is a sci-fi thriller starring John Goodman that I really enjoyed. How does that sound to you? <|endoftext|> Let me check it then. Give me a sec. <|endoftext|> Okay, no problem! Let me know if it sounds good to you. <|endoftext|> Oh I have actually watched that one buddy. Any other suggestions? <|endoftext|> I also have a cool video game adaptation called <|endoftext|> Don't leave me hanging I like games <|endoftext|> Sorry about that, had a glitch there. It's called Resident Evil: The Final Chapter. It's from 2016 and is a great thriller that was nominated for several awards. How does that sound? <|endoftext|> Yes that sounds perfect.

Hmm, have you seen A Quiet Place? <|endoftext|> Yes, I've seen a lot of movies. One of my favorite Horror movies is The Poughkeepsie tapes <|endoftext|> I've never heard of that one. Maybe you should be recommending instead of me! <|endoftext|> Haha, but it's always great when someone knows a good movie that you've never heard of. <|endoftext|> That's so true! What did you like best about Poughkeepsie Tapes? <|endoftext|> It's something that could really happen and it's crazy and scary. I don't want to give away any of the movie to say why it's great. I watched it without knowing anything about it and was surprised that it wasn't more well known. <|endoftext|> Definitely don't spoil it for me! Since it's very good, maybe you'd like to watch it again instead of a new one? <|endoftext|> No, I usually watch it once a year or every two years. Have you seen the new Hansel and Gretel movie? I think it's called Gretel, I wonder if that's good. <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen it. We should watch it and compare notes after! <|endoftext|> That sounds good. It looks very visually appealing. <|endoftext|> I think we've got a winner! Shall we meet online later to chat about it? <|endoftext|> That sounds good. <|endoftext|> Alright!

I personally Watched Avengers Endgame and found it to be an enjoyable film. <|endoftext|> the last film that i watched was Jojo rabbit. im kind of tired of the marvel movies. i feel like its the same film every time i watch it. i like a movie that makes me think theres going to be more.i like cold endings where the viewer can guess what happens next and it changes on what the viewer sees. like in the grey where he fights the wolf in the end it doesnt show who wins but it is up to the viewer to guess <|endoftext|> Ok I understand. If movies with cold endings are your thing, have you ever seen the film Doubt? <|endoftext|> whos in it and what is it about? <|endoftext|> The film stars Meryl Streep and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film is about A nun seeking answers to a mystery within the Church. <|endoftext|> sounds pretty good. is it like spiritual mystery of criminal mystery? <|endoftext|> A little of both actually. would you be interested in watching a trailer? <|endoftext|> yeah sure! sounds right up my ally <|endoftext|> ok great! <|endoftext|> is the movie dark? like color wise? <|endoftext|> Yes, but not too dark that you cant tell whats going on. <|endoftext|> okay some movies get like that. is it a slow moving movie or one that goes pretty Quickly? like with the dark colors and slow moving stroy line you think that someone would fall asleep? im looking to watch one with my GF but she falls asleep often when i put a movie on <|endoftext|> I completely understand where you're coming from. I personally feel the Mystery and intrigue are more than enough to keep viewers on their toes. <|endoftext|> thats good to hear. i probably will end up watching it all. while i do accept the first recommendation. do you have one more for me since we are forced to stay inside for god knows how long? <|endoftext|> ha ha I'm not sure how long this will take but I do have another movie or two. Have you heard of One Hour Photo or K-PAX? <|endoftext|> nope same premis as the first ones? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey how's it going <|endoftext|> Hey, good. <|endoftext|> Any interesting movies you see lately? <|endoftext|> Some recent movies I saw and liked were Knives Out, Uncut Gems and Contagion. I generally like movies with deep characters, an engaging plot and beautiful cinematography. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, I've heard Uncut Gems was really good. Whats you'r favorite part about it? (without giving spoilers?) <|endoftext|> I loved the uneasy feeling that the filmmakers were trying to create. It was also probably the best performance of Adam Sandler's career. <|endoftext|> So are you really into horror that relies more on the psychological aspect rather than jump scares? <|endoftext|> Yeah, definitely. <|endoftext|> Can you name another one in that category you're a fan of? <|endoftext|> I also really liked Hereditary. <|endoftext|> Yeah that's a really good one too. <|endoftext|> Do you have any recommendations based on that? <|endoftext|> The babadook <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, that is a really good one. I've seen it before, but I'd be willing to watch it again. <|endoftext|> How about The Witch <|endoftext|> Yeah, I think that's a good recommendation. <|endoftext|> If you're into some Zombie apocalypse type stuff, I'd definitely reccomend Train to Busan aswell <|endoftext|> I watched that one recently and really enjoyed it. I've been meaning to watch The Wailing as well. <|endoftext|> I loved that movie so much, it blew my mind quite a bit! <|endoftext|> Well, the three you mentioned all sound like pretty solid recommendations. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer for the Witch? <|endoftext|> I'll go watch it when I finish the chat. <|endoftext|> Awesome, sounds good! I'm sure you'll really enjoy it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> HI,  what type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I am into romantic and drama movies <|endoftext|> Do you like animated movies? <|endoftext|> I am not really into animated movies at all <|endoftext|> One of my favorite romance movies is Moonstruck. have you seen it? <|endoftext|> no I have never seen it what is it about ? <|endoftext|> Cher and Nicholas Cage are in it. Cher is engaged to Nicks brother, who hasn't spoken with his brother in years. Cher is asked by her fiance to invite his brother to the wedding, as he is leaving for Italy to visit his mother. Of course when they meet there is instant chemistry. <|endoftext|> Oh ok this sounds like a movie I  would really love to watch. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> wonderful, I really think you'll like it. watch the trailer and I think you'll want to see it as soon as possible. <|endoftext|> Ok great thannk you so much <|endoftext|> also, have you seen four weddings and a funeral? <|endoftext|> Yes I seen that and it was great! <|endoftext|> I loved that movie. great acting and very touching characters. I also really enjoy watching love actually , even though technically it <|endoftext|> I am so into any type of romantic movies. I could never get enough of them. <|endoftext|> yes, I meant to say love actually is technically considered a christmas movie but I enjoy it any time. <|endoftext|> Yes, I totally agree and  I am about to watch the movie after this chat. Thank you again and I definitely accept this recommendation. <|endoftext|> I especially like the story of the couple who gets married and the grooms best friend is in love with the bride as well. She thinks his friend doesn't like her because he avoids her but later tells her it' <|endoftext|> yes stories like this melts my heart lol <|endoftext|> I hit return to soon, he tells her it's self preservation. Anyway, it's been so nice chatting with you and I hope you enjoy all the movies <|endoftext|> It was a pleasure speaking to you and thank you for your time. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you <|endoftext|> Good, how are you? <|endoftext|> Excellent! Watching a lot of movies during this coronavirus time? <|endoftext|> Yes, on Disney and Netflix! Can't really watch them at the theaters right now. <|endoftext|> Same here, I'm lucky I took my kids to the movies just in time last week. <|endoftext|> Yes! That is good, got some good family time in before you're locked inside for who knows how long. <|endoftext|> Yup, I saw The Sonic movie and it was actually really good, way better than i was expecting. <|endoftext|> Was it really? I remember seeing the trailers the first time and everyone was bashing on it! I remember seeing Detective Pikachu in theaters so it might be something close to that type of movie? I'm curious to see it but I want to know the reviews first, haha. <|endoftext|> Yeah Jim Carrey carried the movie, he was way carrying the movie! The redesign of sonic was on point, on the cuter side than the original version. <|endoftext|> Yes, I remember seeing the first trailer and thinking there was no reason to have it be a live animation. It seems like the only reason that movie did or will do well is because of Jim Carrey! Just like how Ryan Reynolds carried Detective Pikachu. What would you give it out of five stars/ <|endoftext|> 3.5 out of 5, unless you were a big sega genesis fan growing up than a 4 out of 5 because there are a lot of little easter eggs in the movie. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I don't really remember a lot about Sega. All I remember is watching the cartoon version! Have you seen any trailers for any upcoming Marvel films, or are you a Marvel Fan. If not, have you seen the new Onward Pixar film? <|endoftext|> Onward is excellent, if you've lost a parent it will hit home and will awaken emotions. I recommend seeing it, for both kids and adults, kids will love just the fun humor and goofy stuff in it, and for adults the themes in it will keep you interested. I lost a parent as a teenager so it hit hard. <|endoftext|> Okay I definitely will go see that then! I just love Pixar and Disney movies because they carry such emotional themes and shocking points that you don't realize in your youth. I actually lost a parent when I was in elementary school, so watching this movie I feel like will just make me appreciate the message and themes they are trying to explain. I have wanted to see it but now I'm scared it might be a little too much, but I will still see it. So sorry about your loss as well. <|endoftext|> Yes pixar can do no wrong in my book, they have not missed on any movie. Go see upward for sure plus Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are too funny together! <|endoftext|> I know I love Tom Holland ever since I saw him do spiderman. He is the perfect fit for the role. And you cannot dislike Chris Pratt, its impossible! <|endoftext|> Exactly they carry on their same Avengers likeability to Upward, plus the mom is Julia Louis Dreyfus and she's hillarious too <|endoftext|> Oh! That's good! I like her as an actress! I love them in the Avengers! <|endoftext|> They all mix together really good, plus the QUOTATION_MARKdadQUOTATION_MARK aka the pants gets into all sorts of shenanigans and its super funny <|endoftext|> I have high hopes for Onward, I've never been disappointed by a Pixar film, so I expect good things. I read a little about the plot and am excited! <|endoftext|> i don't see upward on here, but toy story 4 is lol <|endoftext|> YES! I want to see that again, I just watched it during Christmas with my family! I loved it so much! It had been a long time since the 3rd one came out I thought they would just stop it there. But I was not dissapointed! I will watch it again <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! Can I help recommend any movies for you? <|endoftext|> Yes. I like movies that are comedies. Have you seen any good ones recently? <|endoftext|> I have! Do you have any favorite comedy actors? <|endoftext|> Yes, Chris Rock, Owen Wilson, Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell, Steve Martin. I'm sure there are others also lol. <|endoftext|> Haha, those are some classic funny guys. One more question then I think I have some recommendations. You watching with any kids or just adult comedies? <|endoftext|> Just adult comedies. <|endoftext|> One I have enjoyed with Will Farrell is The Other Guys. Hilarious cop comedy with him and Mark Wahlberg. <|endoftext|> Yes, I love that one! It's very funny. <|endoftext|> It is! I assume you have already seen Step Brother as well. Have you seen Daddy's Home or Daddy's Home 2? <|endoftext|> I actually haven't seen either of them. But since they made a sequel, the first was probably pretty good. Thank you for those recommendations. I will check them out. <|endoftext|> Cool! I am send you a trailer for the first one so you can make sure it's the one for you. <|endoftext|> Ok, thank you. <|endoftext|> I'm not sure why but the combination of Mark Wahlberg's seriousness and Will Farrell's comedy pair up well. <|endoftext|> I agree! They complement each other well. <|endoftext|> I'm hoping they keep working together on some other plots. <|endoftext|> That gives me a good idea. I should check if they have any new upcoming movies together. <|endoftext|> Ha! I had the same thought. You seen anything about any new projects of theirs? <|endoftext|> No, and I just checked online. Nothing yet. <|endoftext|> That's a shame. They have been so successful doing it I'm sure they'll do it again. <|endoftext|> Yes, I agree. I hope so anyway. <|endoftext|> Me too. Hope you enjoy the Daddy's Home trailer and movie. You going to watch it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I will. Thank you so much. Take Care! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I heard that you are looking for a movie to watch. I'd be happy to help! <|endoftext|> Thanks! I like a little bit of everything, mostly comedies. I hate scary movies, though <|endoftext|> I understand, I'm not the biggest fan of horror films either. Are you more into rom coms or general comedic films? <|endoftext|> I usually like general comedic films more than rom coms, a movie that I really liked last year was Booksmart. I thought it was smart and really well done, I'm not usually one for cheesy movies. <|endoftext|> Booksmart is a really great film! One film that I'd recommend checking out that has a similar vibe to it is The Edge of Seventeen. I'm not sure if you've seen it, but it has a solid female friendship behind it and explores themes of self-discovery during adolescence in a smart and funny way as well. <|endoftext|> Great, I've heard of it. I'm going to check it out, thanks so much! <|endoftext|> No problem, if you have any other questions about it , let me know! <|endoftext|> Of course. Who is in the movie? <|endoftext|> It stars, Hailee Steinfeld as the leading actress, as well as Woody Harrelson and Haley Lu Richardson. <|endoftext|> Good to know. Do you know what the plot of the movie is? <|endoftext|> Yes, it is about a girl who is going through a rough time in her life as she is facing the tough challenges of adolescence. To make matters more difficult, she finds out her best friend is dating her brother which leads her to try to find herself independently. <|endoftext|> Do you know who directed it? <|endoftext|> Kelly Fermon Craig was the director. <|endoftext|> Great, I love female directors. What else has she directed? <|endoftext|> I believe that this was her first film as a director, but she is currently working on two films that are set to be released in the future! Based on everything you've heard thus far, are you still into the recommendation? <|endoftext|> I'm definitely interested, I just want to know a little more about the movie since it seems like it's right up my alley. <|endoftext|> of course, I'll be happy to answer any other questions that you may have! <|endoftext|> Awesome, when did the movie come out? <|endoftext|> It came out in 2016. <|endoftext|> Great, so it's somewhat recent. Has it won any awards? <|endoftext|> It won about 6 awards across multiple film festivals and a ton on nominations, including one for a Golden Globe. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, i am here to help you look for a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> hey, I like movies with short run times and lots of action. <|endoftext|> Oh i love action movies! <|endoftext|> Right. James Bond kind of things. Death Star blasting a world type stuff. <|endoftext|> So whats the most recent action move youQUOTATION_MARKve seen? <|endoftext|> I guess it was triple frontier. It had its moments. <|endoftext|> have you seen QUOTATION_MARKAngel has fallenQUOTATION_MARK from the QUOTATION_MARKolympus has fallen seriesQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> No. Is it political? <|endoftext|> I dont feel that it is, I really like Gerrard Bulter in this series, especillay teamed up with Morgan Freeman. very credible story line. <|endoftext|> Morgan Freeman is not a know action star. Does he do his own stunts? <|endoftext|> I doubt he does his own stunts, hes getting up in age. He doesn't do a lot of action, but he is a quality actor ( in my opinion). <|endoftext|> Oh indeed, he has a voice and a presence. <|endoftext|> So, would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I would like to watch the trailer. Is it important to watch the movies in sequence? <|endoftext|> Not necessarily, they are stand alone films, however i would recommend all of them if you haven't seen them. <|endoftext|> OK.  What it the general idea of the movie? <|endoftext|> Gerrard Butler is the man who guards the president, he is accused of assassanating the president, and must clear his name, kind of like Jack Reacher if you saw that movie. <|endoftext|> Yes, I kind of like Jack Reacher movies. Gerrard is another name not really know for action. <|endoftext|> sorry, i misspelled his first name, its actually Gerard Butler, and its an attempted assassination not an actual assassination, (sorry). Jack reacher was an awesome film! <|endoftext|> Attempted, actual. It is all a movie anyway. I can not wait for the trailer. <|endoftext|> Well i hope you enjoy the trailer and hopefully the series (which is three films total) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, do you like wathcing movies? <|endoftext|> Hi! Yes, I like watching movies. <|endoftext|> Is there a certian genre that you like? <|endoftext|> I like a wide variety of movies. I like true crime movies, but I do not like anything too gory or bloody. I also like rom com type movies, but prefer the ones that aren't as predicatable. I don't really like horror or mobster type movies. I like fantasy movies, but not sci fi moveis. <|endoftext|> I like fantasy movies too. What is the last fantasy based movie that you have seen? <|endoftext|> Probably Maleficent 2. <|endoftext|> havent' had time to view that yet, looking forward to watching it though. I am a big Angelina Jolie fan. I looking forward to the new Mulan movie, have you seen the trailor for it? <|endoftext|> Yes! I will definitely go see Mulan in the theater as soon as I am able to. It looks amazing. Maelficent was really good. Rare to find a second part as good as the first and that one was, to me. <|endoftext|> do you like cartoon movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do like cartoon movies, but I prefer the children's movies, not the ones that are geared for adults, like The Simpsons type show. <|endoftext|> I agree. I just recently watched the live version of the Lion's King, have you had a chance to see it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I did! Also a good movie. <|endoftext|> do you go to the movie theatre often or watch at home? <|endoftext|> I actually do both pretty often. Do you have a recommendation of a movie I can watch? <|endoftext|> I was thinking about giving Onward a chance, that's a movie that I would recommend. <|endoftext|> Oh, I haven't seen that yet. That's a good option. I think I will accept that recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> I hope you like it, thank you for chatting with me. <|endoftext|> You, too. <|endoftext|> Walt Disney movies usually don't disappoint. <|endoftext|> I sincerely don't know if there is a single movie from Disney that I haven;t enjoyed, on some level. <|endoftext|> Besides Disney, I'm a big fan of the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit series of movies. <|endoftext|> I love both of those, too, as well as the video games that went along with them. Thanks again for your recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi! Awesome, sounds good! <|endoftext|> So, what genre of movies do you prefer? Also, would you like to watch a recent movie, or an older one? <|endoftext|> i prefer comedies and would like to watch an older one <|endoftext|> Great, who is your favorite comedic actor. Personally, I think Steve Carrell is hilarious! <|endoftext|> i love steve carell! he is my favorite <|endoftext|> Ok! I recently watched a great one featuring him, it was called QUOTATION_MARKDan in Real Life, QUOTATION_MARK have you heard of it? <|endoftext|> no i haven't! <|endoftext|> It's a great movie, I only found out about it through Disney Plus, would you like to watch the trailer for it? <|endoftext|> yes i would love to <|endoftext|> Great!

I actually just finished watching it from beginning to end again <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> im good and you? <|endoftext|> I am fine. What are your movie preferences so I can know the kind of movie trailer I will recommend for you to see? <|endoftext|> i like action comedy <|endoftext|> Do you have a favorite actor or actress you would like to see in the trailer? <|endoftext|> Dwayne Johnson (The Rock) and Jason Statham are my favorite actors and for female actresses i like Sandra Bullock and Jennifer Aniston <|endoftext|> What do you like to see in a movie so I can recommend a movie for you to see? <|endoftext|> Jumanji <|endoftext|> May I ask what you meant by Jumanji? <|endoftext|> I like to see action and romance in a movie <|endoftext|> oh that's cool. would you like to see a movie trailer titled THE DUFF? I bet you will like it because it's a comedy and romance movie. <|endoftext|> sure i would love that, never heard that movie before, looks interesting! <|endoftext|> A high school senior instigates a social pecking order revolution after finding out that she has been labeled the DUFF - Designated Ugly Fat Friend - by her prettier, more popular counterparts <|endoftext|> I would like to see the trailer <|endoftext|> I am happy I was able to recommend a movie trailer for you to see. <|endoftext|> who are the cast on that movie? <|endoftext|> Mae Whitman, Robbie Amell, Bella Thorne, Bianca A. Santos. Would you like to watch the trailer now? <|endoftext|> yes show it to me <|endoftext|> Okay. enjoy the rest of your day. <|endoftext|> thank you for the recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I'm okay, what about you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing good. Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yeah, actually. I've been really getting into Jordan Peele' films, they're great. <|endoftext|> I agree, they are pretty good. Which one is your favorite? <|endoftext|> He's just done Us and Get Out, right? Honestly probably Get Out. The twist was great, and the best friend character was hilarious. <|endoftext|> Yah I liked that one too. Us was pretty wild as well. <|endoftext|> Yeah, but I like Lupita too much to think of her as the evil monster that she was at the end lol. <|endoftext|> I totally get that. I hope he keeps putting out movies in the future. <|endoftext|> Yeah I plan on seeing Candyman. Do you know of any similar directors or films? <|endoftext|> I would recommend the movie Split. I has some good twists and is a good watch. <|endoftext|> Okay, I'll check that out, thank you :) <|endoftext|> Yeah, if you like that one then the next one you watch should be Glass. It is the sequel to Split. <|endoftext|> Cool, thank you for the recommendation :) <|endoftext|> No problem <|endoftext|> What's the basic premise of Split? <|endoftext|> Without giving too much away it is about a man with split personalities and one of them is a very dangerous one. <|endoftext|> That actually sounds like I'd like it. What about Glass? <|endoftext|> Glass follows the same character soon after the first movie and it develops even more with an increase in people like him. <|endoftext|> Sounds like the premise to 28 Days Later/28 Weeks Later. I'll go check those out :D <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? Are you looking for a movie trailer to watch? <|endoftext|> Yes, I am. What type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I myself am really interested in war movies and comedies! How about you? <|endoftext|> I like comedies, both American and International. I also like some spy or mystery films. <|endoftext|> Sounds awesome, I do like spy movies too to be honest. What's the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I started watching QUOTATION_MARKTraitorsQUOTATION_MARK on Netflix, which was produced by BBC 4. It's about a women working as a spy and trying to find a communist mole in the UK right after WW2 <|endoftext|> Well I think you would love the movie QUOTATION_MARKSnowdenQUOTATION_MARK, it has actually been on Netflix before. It is about Edward Snowden an ex-CIA agent who showed the United States all of the vasts amounts of information they have on their citizens. You would love it! Check out the trailer. <|endoftext|> Okay, sure I will check it out. Have you seen the movie QUOTATION_MARK1917QUOTATION_MARK? The cinematography is supposed to be great. <|endoftext|> No, but I have a couple of friends who went to go see it in the movies and said it was phenomenal! I should check it out if you're recommending it too, I will as a matter of fact. <|endoftext|> Snowden is no longer on Netflix. Can you recommend another film to me? Comedy or spy film? <|endoftext|> The Exception is another great movie, it IS on Netflix! It's about a German soldier during the onset of WWII who is sent to see if the Dutch resistance has planted a spy against a German emperor, Kaiser Wilhelm. <|endoftext|> Oh cool. I think I will watch it. I recommend the film QUOTATION_MARKOh LucyQUOTATION_MARK with Josh Harnett that is on Hulu I think. It is about Japanese and American cultural differences. It is a drama-comedy that is good if you like quirky films. <|endoftext|> I love those types of films! Funny thing is I'm super interested in Japanese culture, I find it so fascinating and some of the game shows they have on their TV are HILARIOUS! Haha, thank you for that recommendation! <|endoftext|> Do you watch Terrace House, the TV show? <|endoftext|> No, but I heard is was a Japanese reality show of some sort. Can you explain it to me? <|endoftext|> It's like the 1990s' Real World that was on MTV but it is like a slow drama reality show with good audio and celebrity Japanese hosts who make funny commentaries. It's great if you want to learn more about Japanese culture. It's on Netflix. Thanks for the film recommendation of QUOTATION_MARKThe Exception.QUOTATION_MARK I will check it out. <|endoftext|> Yes I am going to watch it tonight, it sounds really amazing. I'd love to see what it's about first hand! Another movie I recommend is QUOTATION_MARKMurder MysteryQUOTATION_MARK with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston, it is mystery and comedy all in one, I know you like that! It's about a New York cop and his wife who go on vacation and get framed for the murder of an elderly billionaire. You'd love that too! <|endoftext|> I saw Murder Mystery, and I enjoyed it. It was a light movie. I liked the  European locations and the mystery. What is one of your favorite war movies? <|endoftext|> Saving Private Ryan is one hundred percent my top war movie of all time. Super realistic, and Tom Hanks was FANTASTIC! Action and emotion filled. <|endoftext|> Cool. Well it was nice chatting with you. I'll check out The Exception. <|endoftext|> You too, I will check out what you recommended to me also. Have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello!! <|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> In like Suspense thriller and mystery movies! <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Final Wish? <|endoftext|> Not yet. When is it showing? I like the genre of A Quiet Place.. <|endoftext|> It out on DVD/Blu-Ray now but its a pretty good one. If you like A Quiet Place then you might the BirdBox. <|endoftext|> Yess. Definitely! Awesome acting, as expected from the main actress, but the kids! Amazing, both in A Quiet Place. It is hard when acting is based only on facial expression and actions, not verbal scripts only <|endoftext|> Well in Bird Box instead of not being able to speak they are unable to use their sight. Sandra Bullock is the main Actress with a little boy and a little girl. Have you seen Bird Box? <|endoftext|> Yes. They were blindfolded all through out. It is kind of far fetched in reality but because the acting is good, you kind of what if you are in their places. Its like being totally blind literally. <|endoftext|> Another one you might like is Ma. Its about a woman (Octavia Spencer) invites some young kids to her house to have a party but she makes some rules and of course the kids break them and some crazy stuff goes down. I don't want to give it away haha. <|endoftext|> Ya I heard about it, Im interested too but did not have a chance yet to watch it. You like asian scary movies? <|endoftext|> Yes those are the best. They are remaking The Grudge. By the looks of it, it looks like it will be some scary stuff. <|endoftext|> Yes wow its nice to hear other people also enjoying one of my favorite genres. I want to watch The Grudge in theaters. Have you watched The Eye? Korean horror <|endoftext|> Yes I have it was a great one. There is another movie called Ring that is a Japaneses film that the USA remade into The Ring the Japaneses version is so much better super scary. <|endoftext|> Yes that is right. The Ring is the classic example of good asian horror movie. I like your recommendations, I am going to watch The Grudge as soon as it will be available and Ma as well as A Quiet Place too <|endoftext|> I'm glad I could help. Have a great rest of your day. <|endoftext|> Thank you very much, you are a very good recommender. Have a blessed day ahead. <|endoftext|> Thank you, you too. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> The best of luck! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello how are you <|endoftext|> I'm doing good today. Thank you for asking <|endoftext|> no problem.

How are you? <|endoftext|> Good just thinking about watching a movie <|endoftext|> Have anything in mind? <|endoftext|> I am a big Disney fan. I really like Wreck it Ralph because it talks about every day life. <|endoftext|> I've never seen that movie, what's it about? <|endoftext|> It is about video game characters that go into other games or the internet and do different things. It is a very cute movie. i have a young daughter who loves it. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a cute movie. Have you seen Frozen 2 yet? <|endoftext|> Yes it is a good movie but, my daughter is not into it. LOL <|endoftext|> Aw! My 7 year old wants nothing to do with the old Frozen now that the second one is out. We tried watching it last night and she wasn't interested. Do you have any recommendations for any other movies my daughter and I could watch? We like Disney movies a lot too! <|endoftext|> Another good Disney movie is Big Hero 6. It is kind of sad but, it has some good messages in them. My son likes robots so it is kind of about a smart kid that can build robotics. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a good movie for us to watch.

Based on the novel The Good Shepherd by C.S. Forester. <|endoftext|> It seems very interesting! I will definitely look into it. Thank you! <|endoftext|> thanks for response . <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation. Thank you. <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there, I'm Mike, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer to watch <|endoftext|> Hello Mike I'm Dalton <|endoftext|> Nice to meet you Dalton. What kind of movies are you in to? <|endoftext|> I like action movies <|endoftext|> Me too, that's my favorite genre. Do you have a favorite actor? <|endoftext|> My favorite action hero is arnold schwarznegger <|endoftext|> He's one of my faves too, Arnold rules. Do you remember the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> It was a kung fu movie. I don't remember the name of <|endoftext|> It's all good. I like a good kung fu flick too.

I think I got a pretty good idea of your taste in movies, so if you give me a minute, I'm gonna see if I can find a trailer for you. <|endoftext|> ok thanks <|endoftext|> Ok, I selected a movie, did it show up on your screen? <|endoftext|> no it didn't show up <|endoftext|> Ok, the movie I selected is Birth of the Dragon, which came out in 2016. It's kind of a fictionalized account of Bruce Lee's early days in San Francisco. It's got lots of good fight scenes in it. <|endoftext|> I want to watch that movie, sounds interesting <|endoftext|> Ok, sounds good man. Thanks for chatting with me. The trailer should pop up soon. <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> No problem. Give the trailer a try, and if it looks good check the movie out. <|endoftext|> Ok, will do. Have a nice day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hey <|endoftext|> What are some of your favorite movies? <|endoftext|> The Notebook, Togo, movies like that <|endoftext|> Those are two very different movies! What do you like about The Notebook? <|endoftext|> I like the way it reflects real life people, even though the ending is a bit hard to believe. <|endoftext|> And what do you like about Togo? <|endoftext|> I lived in Alaska for years and I could relate to the characters in that movie <|endoftext|> I have always wanted to see Alaska! What is the most recent movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Bad with Titles....oh yeah, Fast and Furious 2 <|endoftext|> Did you enjoy The Fast and Furious 2? <|endoftext|> It wasn't my favorite. I was expecting to see more cars but all I got was a silly plot. <|endoftext|> What are some of your least favorite movies? <|endoftext|> Fast and Furious 2 for sure. Date with the Devil, Final Destination <|endoftext|> What did you dislike about Final Destination? <|endoftext|> Just wasn't my cup of tea. Not into violent unrealistic movies <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Drive? It has some action, more realistic than Final Destination, and it won and was nominated for many awards. <|endoftext|> I have not <|endoftext|> Does the movie sound interesting to you? Here is the plot: A mysterious Hollywood stuntman and mechanic moonlights as a getaway driver and finds himself in trouble when he helps out his neighbor in this action drama. <|endoftext|> I think I would enjoy that. It does sound interesting <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> I'll look for it this evening. Thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailerQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Thank you. I am interested in finding a comedy movie. Any reccomendations? <|endoftext|> What is the last movie that you watched <|endoftext|> parasite <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie with similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> I would like a movie with a different story line <|endoftext|> Hang tight, while I look for the perfect movie trailer for you <|endoftext|> Sounds good <|endoftext|> Would you like to stick with a drama/ Mystery like Parasite or comedy like you said originally? <|endoftext|> Comedy please! <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen The English Teacher <|endoftext|> No I haven't. What is it about? <|endoftext|> A teacher Linda is going on blind dates, and unhappy, until one day a former student comes to town. Jason is a writer  looking to give that up and become a lawyer and Linda request that Jason allows the first play to be performed at her school based on Jason's writing. This is a Comedy, Drama Movie <|endoftext|> I think I'd like this movie! <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch this movie trailer <|endoftext|> yes, send it over <|endoftext|> I will sent the chat right over. <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> I actually googled the trailer and this is a movie I am adding to my list to watch <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help recommend you a movie! How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm great! How are you? I'm a huge fan of horror films - particularly those that deal more with dread than gore. <|endoftext|> Oh man, I love horror movies! What have you seen recently that you liked? <|endoftext|> The last horror film I saw and liked was A Quiet Place. Such a unique film that relied on silence! <|endoftext|> I saw that too, extremely interesting. Would you want a movie with a similar story line, or perhaps something a little different? <|endoftext|> A similar story is fine - But I'd prefer a more traditional film that isn't nearly 100% silent. But something with dread! <|endoftext|> I see. I am not as much a fan of all silence as well, but I think it can be extraordinarily creepy if the sound is done right. I have a movie in mind that I was much a fan of. The gore is there, lighter but extreme when it does happen. I would suggest you try looking up The Transfiguration. It's a drama/horror flick and I found it to be moving. <|endoftext|> Interesting. I am willing to give fire a shot - I just always favor that feeling of dreadQUOTATION_MARK in horror. Can you explain to me what The Transfiguration is about? <|endoftext|> The Transfiguration is about a seemingly normal boy who believes he is a vampire. He is dark and withdrawn, and believes he is a monster. You get to follow him through a snapshot of his story, and all of it is very dark. <|endoftext|> That actually sounds like an intriguing and unique premise. Plus a fresh take on the vampire genre. Is it a newer film (like within the last 15 years)? Or older? <|endoftext|> It came out in 2016 in the Cannes Film Festival from an Australian director. Haha, I had a Shudder account for a brief time and found it there while I was movie binging. <|endoftext|> Was it well received at Cannes? I know just being accepted there tells me it should be a great movie! <|endoftext|> It was well received and nominated for a few prizes but won nothing at Cannes. It did however win the General Jury prize at Dublin International in 2017. <|endoftext|> Honestly though, just being nominated is an accomplishment in itself. Do you know the Rotten Tomatoes score? <|endoftext|> It's got 85% on Rotten Tomatoes! Only a 6/10 on IMDB but I think they were being a little hard on it for being an Indie film. It's almost slow moving in its thoughtfulness, but really pulled me in with its unique take on the theory of vampirism. <|endoftext|> 85 is a great score considering how harsh Rotten Tomatoes can be. But the fact that you said it's slow moving in its thoughtfulness really piques my interest as I can't stand fast paced horror films plagued with jump scares. Does anyone famous star in it? <|endoftext|> No, it's a film full of fresh meat! I actually sort of prefer horror movies this way, because you can go into it almost blind and you can really evaluate the talent or passion of the actors involved. I also love lesser known directors as I feel like they're willing to take shots other more well known directors might not take or just plain overdo. Do you look for more famous actors when you look for horror films? <|endoftext|> So true! And honestly, I don't as I feel having someone you don't know makes it easier to relate where as with someone famous, it's a distraction because you already QUOTATION_MARKkmow themQUOTATION_MARK. I think I may just accept your recommendation and check it out! Is there anything else I should know about it beforehand? <|endoftext|> I forgot to mention it's lightly romantic, but in a confusing (at least to me) way. Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Actually I'd love to watch it. Can you send me a link? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Hey! <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you prefer? <|endoftext|> I like most movies, but I prefer romance and sci-fi. <|endoftext|> What was the latest movie you've watched? <|endoftext|> The latest movie I watched was Gladiator. <|endoftext|> What did you like about it? <|endoftext|> I really like the characters. I think the director did a good job of giving me a character to root for. I also really like the cinematography. It has some really beautiful images. <|endoftext|> Would you like a movie recommendation closer to Gladiator? Perhaps directed by the same director? <|endoftext|> That would be awesome. Ridley Scott is actually my favorite director so I enjoy most of his work. <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Hannibal? <|endoftext|> No I haven't. Do you mind to tell me more about it? <|endoftext|> It's directed by Ridley Scott and it is very well done in my opinion. It's about a very well respected Baltimore forensic psychiatrist who is also a cannibalistic serial killer. Once caught for his crimes, he agrees to help the FBI find other serial killers <|endoftext|> Oooh, I like the sound of that. I really enjoy crime movies. Can I ask who is in it? <|endoftext|> Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta <|endoftext|> Oh my god, nice. I love Anthony Hopkins and Gary Oldman. I will definitely accept and watch your recommendation. Do you have any more? Maybe just personal favorites of yours? With this whole quarantine thing, I really need things to watch. <|endoftext|> I also definitely would watch Silence of the Lambs, it's a 1991 film starring Jodie Foster and it's part of the Hannibal series. It also has Anthony Hopkins in it as he plays Dr. Hannibal Lecter as well in this one. It's a very interesting set of films and will have you on the edge of your seat <|endoftext|> I have seen that one, but I had no idea it was a series deal. I definitely have to watch Silence of the Lambs if I watch Hannibal. I will accept both of your recommendations. Thank you very much! Was there anything else you wanted to say that you could think of? <|endoftext|> No, I think that's it. Is there any questions for me? <|endoftext|> None that I can think of. Thank you for the recommendations! Have a good day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> hi. <|endoftext|> what type of movies you into? <|endoftext|> preferably comedy <|endoftext|> me too, what was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> either Stranger Than Fiction (with Will Ferrell) or Murder Mystery (Adam Sandler Jennifer Anniston) <|endoftext|> I likeQUOTATION_MARKThe Other GuysQUOTATION_MARK with Will Ferrell made me laugh the whole time. <|endoftext|> Nice. I would recommend step brothers to you if youre a will ferrel fan <|endoftext|> Seen it as well great movie QUOTATION_MARKThe Other GuysQUOTATION_MARK has an allstar cast of Mark Wahlberg, Michael Keaton, The Rock, Samuel Jackson, Rob Riggle. really cool <|endoftext|> Nice. Never seen it. Will Ferrel's new movie with Julia Lewie Dreyfus also looks promising <|endoftext|> haven't seen it yet <|endoftext|> It's called Downhill. Have you seen Stranger Than Fiction? <|endoftext|> not yet.. what about goofball comedies like QUOTATION_MARKFifty Shades of BlackQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Never heard or seen it, but is it like Scary Movie or Not Another Teen Movie? One of those QUOTATION_MARKmake fun of everythingQUOTATION_MARK movies? Either way, I would watch it <|endoftext|> yeah pretty funny <|endoftext|> Nice. Yeah I would watch that. Haven't seen a movie like that in a long time <|endoftext|> I like those over the top comedy movies like that. Scary Movie when the weed plant smokes smokey lol had me dying. <|endoftext|> Lol that was good. I liked Not Another Teen Movie. A lot of memorable quotes in that one. <|endoftext|> even the og movies like naked gun as well haha <|endoftext|> Never seen that one <|endoftext|> Thank you for your time and recomendations <|endoftext|> You too <|endoftext|> take care <|endoftext|> You too <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Honestly I really do love the John Wick movies, my brother told me about them and I watched all three recently and truly love the detail put in about the story and the detail in the action scenes. Truly one of Keanu Reeves' best movies since the Matrix trilogy in my opinion. <|endoftext|> I dont think i have seen those before, what genre are they? <|endoftext|> I would say they are action with some satirical humor thrown in at times. <|endoftext|> okay, cool. I could be interested in that. Do you have any recommendations for psychological drama genre? <|endoftext|> I think Memento is a good one with Guy Pearce where he can't form any new memories so when he encounters something new he has to tattoo a form of the experience on him, making the tattoos the title of the movie QUOTATION_MARKmementosQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> that sounds really good! <|endoftext|> I remember I watched it for a college class I think it was political science and I really did fall in love with it. The end is truly one of a kind. <|endoftext|> That sounds awesome, I think I'm gonna watch it. I really like movies like that. Ones with weird twists and good cinematography. Thanks! <|endoftext|> No problem at all, I'm glad I was able to help, it's difficult to find good movies sometimes it seems. <|endoftext|> Yeah, did you like the joker? I thought it was really good. I also really liked the Dark Night Batman movies <|endoftext|> Yes, and I forgot to mention that the same director, Christopher Nolan directed Memento too speaking of those movies, and yes I thought the Joker was an excellent film, I love it when you can see the character slowly start to change throughout the film, whether it's improving or succumbing to madness like Joaquin Pheonix was able to do in that move with his character. <|endoftext|> OMG no way! that is crazy... I had no idea. You must be good at reccommending movies then. lol I love all Christophen Nolan movies and the Cinematographer he works with is amazing! <|endoftext|> Thank you for the compliment, but I'm no expert I just happened to notice it was him and when you mentioned the Dark Knight films I was like, QUOTATION_MARKOh yeah I remember he directed that movieQUOTATION_MARK. <|endoftext|> Haha, wierd. What are some other ones similar to memento that you like? <|endoftext|> That's a tough one because it is a unique film, but going off of the genre you mentioned earlier, psychological drama, I think Identity is another good one where the main guy has schizophrenia and his personalities end up killing each other within his own head. It's quite a brain twister. <|endoftext|> oh wow, that makes me think of that movie, A Beautiful Mind <|endoftext|> Yes that one is also excellent, a classic Russell Crowe movie. <|endoftext|> yeah, that one was also pretty sad <|endoftext|> Another one sort of like those I argue is part of that drama is Phonebooth, although there is a lot of action in it, and possibly more thriller than drama, but I think it's so brilliantly done that I definitely would mention that too when it comes to psychological drama type of movies, definitely my favorite Collin Farrell movie of all time. <|endoftext|> That sounds great, Ill look that one up as well. I like thrillers sometimes. I also loved that new movie Parasite as well. Movies that make a political statement in a way i guess. <|endoftext|> One movie that I didn't realize was designed to make a political statement until I watched a behind the scenes on it recently was Dawn of the Dead, the originial 1975 version. Romero described that the whole consumerism thing was his inspiration, where the mall shoppers are like zombies. A classic, and when you think about it, you can see that in the film. <|endoftext|> Interesting, I think I am going to go watch the Memento movie. I definitely have a lot of time on my hands. Dawn of the Dead would be cool to look up some YouTube videos explaining that. Thanks for your help! Have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Can I help you find a movie today? <|endoftext|> Sure, can you give me a recommendation? <|endoftext|> Let me find out a little more about you first. What do you like to typically watch? <|endoftext|> I'm a fan of a couple of things. I like comedies, sci-fi, or action movies. <|endoftext|> Ok, that's a broad range! Let's narrow down a little further. What are you in the mood for right now? <|endoftext|> Well, with the virus, I'd love something a little more lighthearted I guess. One of my favorite movies is QUOTATION_MARKWhat We Do in the ShadowsQUOTATION_MARK, so do you know anything in that vein? <|endoftext|> That's the vampire movie, right? Do you want to stick with lighthearted vampire fun, or just cheesy fantasy in general? <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's like a mockumentary about vampires, it's hilarious. Cheesy fantasy works for me, or anything with Taika Waititi, honestly. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Jojo Rabbit yet? <|endoftext|> I haven't. <|endoftext|> It's directed by Tika Waititi and is a comedy set in Nazi era Germany. <|endoftext|> That sounds like a great recommendation. Thanks! I'll take a look. <|endoftext|> I think you'll really like it. It got a 7.1 on IMDB and 80% on Rotten Tomatoes. <|endoftext|> Have you heard whether it's funny or not? <|endoftext|> It's a mix of really funny and a little tragic. But I guess it's hard not to have a little tragedy when you're talking about WW2 and Hitler. How do you feel about Scarlett Johansson? <|endoftext|> Ha, that's true enough. I think she's ok. A little overrated, but better than most. <|endoftext|> Taika Waititi plays Hitler, too. <|endoftext|> That sounds pretty great. <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would, thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> I really hope you like it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you ? <|endoftext|> i am good <|endoftext|> So what type of movies are u into ? action, drama, or romance <|endoftext|> romance <|endoftext|> cool. whats the last romance movie youve watched? <|endoftext|> Berlin ,I Love YOU <|endoftext|> is that the movie with hayden panettiere in it ? she also played in bring it on . <|endoftext|> when ever you go,love will find you.this is the most dialogue in the movie <|endoftext|> that sounds like a good movie . <|endoftext|> Yes.it was awesome <|endoftext|> i really believe you would love the movie the best of me <|endoftext|> the story also good <|endoftext|> yes its about two highschool sweethearts who reunite after twenty years <|endoftext|> might be they are in good position,it means JOB <|endoftext|> well not exactly , they came back to town for an old friends funeral and saw each other after all those yearsyou should watch the trailer from what u explained u liked about the berlin i love you movie i believe youll be interested in this one as well <|endoftext|> they will remember there school age if they watch <|endoftext|> seeing eachother after all that time brought back alot of old feelings between the two <|endoftext|> they will discuss the good and bad in there life <|endoftext|> yes they will actually , its a romance movie but has drama as well <|endoftext|> so there is chance share those things <|endoftext|> yes would u like me to send you the trailer so you can view a sneak peek of the movie <|endoftext|> yes,sure.if i get a chance to share ,i will do <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? Seen anything recently that you liked? <|endoftext|> I like action movies and military or sci-fi movies the best <|endoftext|> That's great, do you prefer stuff that's realistic or do you prefer stuff that's out there? <|endoftext|> I prefer realistic but don't mind watching something out there every once in a while <|endoftext|> Gotta watch stuff that's out there sometimes, but realistic is good too. <|endoftext|> True that! <|endoftext|> So I imagine a sci-fi military movie would be great for you. <|endoftext|> Yeah for sure <|endoftext|> Any particular director's you're fond of? <|endoftext|> I don't have a good memory for directors, there's one I remember I like but don't remember even which films of there's I prefer, Christopher Nolan, JJ Abrams come to mind <|endoftext|> Have you seen Ender's Game? <|endoftext|> I don't think so, I've heard of it before but didn't get around to seeing it yet <|endoftext|> I thought it was pretty good. Maybe not for everyone but should be satisfying if you're into futuristic takes on military ethics. <|endoftext|> Yeah, for sure, I will give it a try, sounds like it might be a good fit for me <|endoftext|> Cool, it's got Harrison Ford in it and it's based on a good book. <|endoftext|> Yeah, someone recommended me the book before, but I will watch the movie instead, thanks for the recc. <|endoftext|> No problem, I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will, have a nice day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Awesome! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I like all kinds of movies except horror.

I love Marvel movies! <|endoftext|> Me too! Almost all of the Marvel movies have a great balance of action and comedy. <|endoftext|> I watch them with my best friends, and we always laugh so much at the jokes! <|endoftext|> What are your feelings about DC movies? <|endoftext|> They're okay but I prefer Marvel! Have you by any chance seen Avengers: Endgame? <|endoftext|> I have. I saw it in theaters and I've watched it again through Disney + <|endoftext|> What were your thoughts on it? I loved it. <|endoftext|> I did too. I cried at the end but overall I thought it was amazing <|endoftext|> Did you get a chance to watch Captain Marvel? <|endoftext|> Yup! I saw that one in theaters too. My sister has a cat that looks just like Goose. <|endoftext|> That's so cool! One of my favorite Marvel movies is actually Ant-Man. It came out in 2015, did you get a chance to see that? <|endoftext|> I saw the first one but I haven't seen the 2nd one yet... <|endoftext|> The second one is so good! I definitely recommend watching Ant-Man and the Wasp! <|endoftext|> I will definitely check that out! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Are you looking for recommendations for movie trailers? <|endoftext|> Yes I am <|endoftext|> What kinds of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Action movies <|endoftext|> Have you seen any action movies that you liked lately? <|endoftext|> Yes I have <|endoftext|> Which movies were they? <|endoftext|> Avengers, Brids of Prey <|endoftext|> You like superhero movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I do <|endoftext|> Have you seen Justice League or Suicide Squad? <|endoftext|> Yes I have <|endoftext|> Are you interested in Marvel movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I am <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the Thor movies? <|endoftext|> Yes i have <|endoftext|> Have you seen Avengers Infinity War or Endgame? <|endoftext|> Yes I Have <|endoftext|> Would you be interested in seeing a little-known superhero movie that's not part of a Marvel or DC franchise? <|endoftext|> Yes I would <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello friend! <|endoftext|> Good afternoon! I'm looking for a movie recommendation, something to get my mind off of the current status of our country. I love comedies and since laughter is the best medicine, I'd like to find a family friendly comedy to lift my spirits. <|endoftext|> Sure, have you seen Inside Out or CoCo? The creators have made another movie coming out soon. <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen either one. Any actors I would recognize in Inside Out? <|endoftext|> Inside Out is an animated movie by Disney, It's definitely family friendly, not really a comedy <|endoftext|> That sounds like an excellent recommendation! Thank you! Hope you have a nice weekend, goodbye :) <|endoftext|> Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Richard Kind are among the cast <|endoftext|> Amy Poehler is a hoot! <|endoftext|> I really like the movie, very easy to relate. Definitely gives you that warm feeling afterward. <|endoftext|> Is CoCo animated as well? <|endoftext|> Yes, it is. <|endoftext|> Would you say their are morals/lessons learned targeted towards children in one or both of these? <|endoftext|> I would say so. In my opinion, Inside out shows children that it is normal to have crazy mixture of emotion during stressful times. The key is to have good communication with people you trust. Coco shows the importance of family and tradition. <|endoftext|> I personally feel that it is very important that children know that it's okay to 'feel' different ways. I'm leaning towards watching Inside Out first. What year was that released? <|endoftext|> I agree. It was released in 2015 <|endoftext|> Would you happen to know if either of these films are currently offered on Netflix? <|endoftext|> Inside Out is not on Netflix, but you can find it on Youtube, GooglePlay, and Amazon Prime for $3, same for Coco <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I have an Amazon Prime account. Are these movies both rated G? <|endoftext|> They are both rated PG <|endoftext|> I thank you again for your recommendations and taking the time to answer my questions. I plan to accept your recommendations and watch both with the family this weekend. <|endoftext|> Awesome, enjoy <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like to watch <|endoftext|> I like Chick Flicks <|endoftext|> What's the last one that you've watched? <|endoftext|> The last one I watched was The Vamps. It's an old, kinda stupid movie <|endoftext|> I haven't watched many chick flicks, but I have had friends who said that Pitch Perfect is a great one. <|endoftext|> I've already watched all of the Pitch Perfects <|endoftext|> Another good one that I've heard my sister speak of is a girl on a train <|endoftext|> What's that one about? <|endoftext|> It's kind of a mystery drama based around a book between a couple. <|endoftext|> I'm going to need more than that <|endoftext|> The main character normally sees a couple on a train, then one day sees something happen in the couple's backyard. She then finds out that the girl in the couple is now missing and reports it to the police, but also starts to investigate on her own. <|endoftext|> Ah a nosy main character. In real life she would be crazy. Sounds interesting. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Okay, it says that we have to chat a bit more <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie recommendation too? <|endoftext|> sure gimme one <|endoftext|> Have you seen Parasite? The Korean One <|endoftext|> i have not <|endoftext|> It's really interesting and will make you think about life. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I am well and you? <|endoftext|> Glad to hear it. I am doing pretty good just surviving this storm we have going on with all this corona virus stuff lol. It actually gives me more reasons to stay inside and watch more movies I have fallen behind on. I just got done watching Contagion last night. What kind of movies and stuff do you watch? <|endoftext|> Haha that is funny you mention Contagion, I also just watched thay because of all this craziness. I usually like a solid, creative plot - also I do like scifi as well but not superhero movies. I am exhausted of superhero movies. <|endoftext|> I can't say I blame you about the superhero thing they have kind of beaten that one into the ground. I am glad you like Sci-FI! I do too! Have you ever seen I am Legend with Will Smith? I thought it was really well done and loved Will Smith and his struggle with being alone and trying to deal with his own depression while trying to survive it all! <|endoftext|> Actually no I haven't but I really like Will Smith and that sounds like a plot I would enjoy. I was also looking for a recommendation to watch for later tonight. I also enjoy watching a character go through the hero's journey, if you will, so it sounds like i'll check that out! I approve of that recommendation and thank you for the advice! <|endoftext|> Of course! I think you will love it especially with you liking Sci-Fi and strong plot lines. Maybe check check out the trailer and get a preview of what you are getting into. Bring snacks and a friend to hold onto lol. There are some pretty intense moments and some really sad ones too. I am glad you have a plan for the night now. Would you like to watch this Trailer? <|endoftext|> Yeah I think there aren't many actors who can hold a movie alone but Will Smith definitely can. I will! I'll make sure to watch the trailer first. Thanks again. Yes, I would like to watch this trailer. <|endoftext|> Of course mate. Please enjoy it I have seen it like 5 times or more haha. It'll absolutely hold your attention and Mr. Smith is awesome. Have a great rest of your day and I hope my advise leads you to another classic you love. Take Care, J <|endoftext|> Thanks again! Have a good one :) <|endoftext|> Hey I think I can actually send this trailer to you if you would like? <|endoftext|> Actually that would be very helpful, if you don't mind. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Of course. I am working on getting that over to you now or I can send you a link to the right one. <|endoftext|> Okay thanks, I appreciate it as i'm not too savvy on the computer. Do you have a link by chance? <|endoftext|> You got it! Also, What was the last thing you saw Will Smith in aside from this movie you are going to watch tonight? <|endoftext|> Perfect, thanks! I would have to say the latest release of Bad Boys with Martin Lawrence. I can't remember if the name is Bad Boys 3 or a spinoff name like Bad Boys QUOTATION_MARKReloadedQUOTATION_MARK - Also I wanted to see him in Gemini Man but never did. Have you heard how that movie is or seen it? <|endoftext|> I have seen Gemini Man and I have to say maybe not his best work but was still entertaining for something lazy and entertaining. Also, I love the Bad Boys series lol. They remind me of my childhood. <|endoftext|> Haha yes! Did you watch the Fresh Prince of Bel Air at all? I did as kid <|endoftext|> Oh yea! That was my Jam. I am pretty sure on a yearly basis I go back and watch a few episodes so the theme song is forever stuck in my head... Aka: its happening right now...... lol I guess I have been following his work for a very very long time now. <|endoftext|> Haha yeah I mean think he was only around 17, 18 when he started the show, possibly younger. And he's still in Hollywood! So we basically watched him grow up as we did <|endoftext|> Yes, Same here. I pretty much grew up that way. <|endoftext|> Well thank you so much for giving me the recommendation and the link to watch that trailer. I will definitely do that! Take care :) <|endoftext|> you too! Enjoy <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you? I'd love to know what type of movies you're into. <|endoftext|> Hi! I'm really into horror movies. Have you seen Midsommar recently? <|endoftext|> No I haven't, most horror movies scare me too much. Did you see the new IT? <|endoftext|> I haven't yet! Not the one where they're all adults. <|endoftext|> I've heard really great things about it. Quite a few people I know have raved about it. Is it something you'd be interested in? <|endoftext|> Yeah, it would be. I think it'll be something I really enjoy. <|endoftext|> I hope you like it. I remember right after it came out my coworker would leave a red balloon in the break room to freak people out. <|endoftext|> I think I will. The first one spooked me out a bit. Clowns freak me out, lol. <|endoftext|> Oh for sure me too. What about the movie Child's Play? I remember the originals from being little. Did you see the new one? <|endoftext|> No. I haven't. Isn't Audrey Plaza in it though? <|endoftext|> Yep! I bet she's good in it, she's a great actress. <|endoftext|> Yeah, she's awesome. I'll probably check it out just for her. <|endoftext|> Nice, hope you like it! <|endoftext|> We'll see. I think a doll as a horror villain is a little silly. It's the kind of horror you just laugh at. <|endoftext|> Haha that's a really good point. I'd still be scared probably though. <|endoftext|> Lol, I just imagine me like throwing the doll or something. Do you know any horror movies that are more based on real life and not supernatural? <|endoftext|> Yeah Texas Chainsaw Massacre and that one with Paul Walker and the truck drivers, I can't remember the name of it. <|endoftext|> Texas Chainsaw Massacre? What's it about? <|endoftext|> This group of friends goes to see if one of their grandparents graves was vandalized and a bunch of psycho murderers that live next door attack them and they have to escape. <|endoftext|> Gnarly. I'll be sure to check it out. Thanks for all these movie recommendations! <|endoftext|> No problem! Hope some of them work out for you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good! Thank you for asking!

Have you seen the trailer for QUOTATION_MARKUsQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> I have not, what is that about? <|endoftext|> It is another Jordan Peele movie. It's about a family that must fight for survival once 4 masks strangers show up in their lives. It has many plot twists like QUOTATION_MARKGet OutQUOTATION_MARK. I think you would really enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> I did like Get Out so I would probably like this movie. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great! It was an awesome movie that had me on the edge of my seat the whole time! <|endoftext|> That sounds amazing, thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Of course! It has action, suspense, and even a few laughs all in one <|endoftext|> That's good to know! Jordan Peele is on fire these days <|endoftext|> Agreed! I can't wait to see what he does next <|endoftext|> Same, do you know if he has any other movies in the making? <|endoftext|> I heard he was doing a remake of QUOTATION_MARKCandymanQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Oh yea!

I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> yo yo for all thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I'm here to help recommend a movie. <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Parasite. I really like dramas that are suspenseful. <|endoftext|> I watched that one. It won a few Grammy Awards. <|endoftext|> Um, I think you mean Oscars since Grammys are for music. At least I think that's correct. Do you have any recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> Did you see the movie Us? It came out in 2019. Yes I meant Oscars. <|endoftext|> I did see Us - loved it! That director, who's name I forget, also directed Get Out a couple of years ago. Another fantastic film. <|endoftext|> I see you like suspense, I can recommend the movie Midsommar. It was colorful but also scary. <|endoftext|> Oh, I haven't seen that one. I'll check it out - thank you! <|endoftext|> Do you like Sci-fi movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I do. <|endoftext|> I'd recommend you watch a trailer for Midsommar. <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation. Thank you. <|endoftext|> If you like Sci-fi movies with lots of suspense and drama, I would also recommend Snowpiercer. Like Parasite, it is also a Korean director. <|endoftext|> I've discovered I like Korean movies. I've seen Snowpiercer and also Last Train to Busan which is a zombie movie. <|endoftext|> Do you like classic/older movies? Or more modern films? <|endoftext|> I do like the classics but prefer newer films. <|endoftext|> I find newer films to be easier to watch although I do like classics too. I watch more newer films. <|endoftext|> Me too. I'm looking forward to seeing more movies this summer. <|endoftext|> Same here. I still think Midsommar is a good choice right now. <|endoftext|> I'll have to check it out. <|endoftext|> Enjoy! I hope you like it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you? <|endoftext|> Great although a bit anxious because of the pandemic! <|endoftext|> I totally get that! I'm here to help! <|endoftext|> I'm thinking that now is a time to escape for a while and go back in time to a kinder, gentler place <|endoftext|> What was the last movie that you watched like that? <|endoftext|> Little Women directed by Greta Gerlich <|endoftext|> Oh that's so good! I watched that with my daughter! I like period pieces as well <|endoftext|> I especially like what the director did with the time sequences jumping out of order. It kept the movie from being to predictable. <|endoftext|> yes! I love it when it keeps me engaged and wanting to know what is next! <|endoftext|> So I'm looking for a film that has that similar quality, and sympathetic characters. And of course, no extreme violence. I also like films that present women overcoming obstacles. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Lady Bird? It's a coming of age indie film also by Greta Gerwig <|endoftext|> That was with Sacirse Ronan and Timothee Chalamet? I have seen it but don't exactly remember the story, so that is a great suggestion for watching tonight! <|endoftext|> Would you like to see the trailer to see if it jogs your memory? It's a coming of age story and Saoirse Ronan is pretty amazing! <|endoftext|> That would be great! Is it set in present time? <|endoftext|> It is - 2002 I believe! <|endoftext|> Are you sending me the link to the trailer? If so, I will be glad to watch it and most likely to view the movie. I also like Laurie Metcalf, who is in the movie. <|endoftext|> I am! Laurie was my favorite character in the old sitcom Roseanne! <|endoftext|> Oh, yes, of course - totally forgot that she was in Roseanne. Not sure if you are actually sending a link to Lady Bird, but now I am eager to watch it again as there are so many in the cast that I really like. I think I remember a scene with mother and daughter in Goodwill. Is that right? <|endoftext|> Yes! You are right!! I think it's a considered a classic moment now :) <|endoftext|> I really don't need to see the trailer. I fully intend to curl up with a cup of tea and watch QUOTATION_MARKLady BirdQUOTATION_MARK tonight. Thank you so very much for reminding me of a movie I really liked a lot! Have a good evening - I know I will. <|endoftext|> yay! here it is just in case :)  Enjoy your evening!!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hey there <|endoftext|> What's the last movie you've watched? <|endoftext|> the autopsy of jane doe <|endoftext|> Did you like it? <|endoftext|> yeah! it was scary haha! <|endoftext|> I've never seen it, but it looks really creepy! Do you like scary movies? <|endoftext|> yea they are my favorite! have you heard of any new ones? <|endoftext|> Yes, my most recent favorites are Hereditary and Midsommar. Have you seen those? They're not really jump-scary, but they're really creepy and disturbing. <|endoftext|> I have seen Hereditary, but Midsommar i should check out! <|endoftext|> Yes!! They're both Ari Aster films. <|endoftext|> i just watched the trailer, i will probably stream it tonight! thanks for the reccomendation. <|endoftext|> No problem! Have you seen Us or Get Out? <|endoftext|> us was awesome! i like the twists in the story...I haven't heard of Get out <|endoftext|> They're both by Jordan Peele. Get Out has a similar vibe, but it's more of a social commentary. Do you want to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> yea sounds good to  me! <|endoftext|> Ok, I will send it in a moment! Have you heard of ABC's of Death? <|endoftext|> my girlfriend has seen it but i have not, you gave me 3 awesome recommendations! <|endoftext|> Awesome!! Hope you like them. Just give me a second and I'll send you the trailer to Get Out <|endoftext|> sounds good to me <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good day! <|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> I would like to assist you in finding a movie for you to enjoy. <|endoftext|> ok <|endoftext|> What movie genres do you enjoy watching? <|endoftext|> action movies <|endoftext|> Is there a recent action movie that you've seen to point me in the right direction? <|endoftext|> Taken Two <|endoftext|> Would you enjoy watching a movie played by Bruce Willis? <|endoftext|> Yes I would <|endoftext|> I'd suggest watching Die Hard by Bruce Willis. It's about a NYPD officer that is forced to save his wife and her co-workers from a skyscraper held hostage by German Terrorists. <|endoftext|> ohh that sounds interesting <|endoftext|> The movie is well-recommended with a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes. <|endoftext|> I would like to watch the trailer <|endoftext|> Sure thing! <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> You certainly welcome! I hope you enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> Good Bye <|endoftext|> Did you have any other movies that you may be interested in?

I am looking for a comedy movie similar to Step Brothers <|endoftext|> I'm more than happy to find a similar movie. May I ask the name of an additional recent comedy movie that you have seen to better assist me in this search? <|endoftext|> I also enjoyed The Campaign. I am a fan of Will Farrell. <|endoftext|> Perhaps you would enjoy the movie Anchorman staring Will Ferrell. He plays the role of a new anchor in the 1970's and is intimidated by a new female co-anchor in a male dominated industry of broadcasting. <|endoftext|> Excellent! I will be sure to check it out. Thank you for your help! <|endoftext|> Your welcome! Enjoy! <|endoftext|> Have you seen this movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, I have. It's one of my favorites. There is multiple movies in the series. <|endoftext|> How many movies are there in the series? <|endoftext|> Two thus far. There is speculation of a third edition. <|endoftext|> Do you like the first or the second one better? <|endoftext|> In my opinion, the original is always the best. <|endoftext|> I tend to agree! <|endoftext|> So would you care to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would! <|endoftext|> Would you like the both trailers? <|endoftext|> Why not? That way I can evaluate both movies. <|endoftext|> I'll send you the original first. <|endoftext|> Sounds good! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there how are you today? <|endoftext|> Hey there. i am good and you? <|endoftext|> im  pretty good just staying in taking care of myself with all this crisis going on.

What kind of movies are you interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> Actually I love adventure <|endoftext|> I do too! Very entertaining. what was the last adventure film you watched? <|endoftext|> I just had to re-watch Polar all over again last week <|endoftext|> I didn't see that one yet but Jonas Akerlund directed that and I love his work. He also makes great music videos. <|endoftext|> Yeah, he is a great director. I loved his Lords of chaos as well <|endoftext|> SO movie that reminds me somewhat of Polar (what I've heard of it) that I thought was excellant is Atomic Blonde, starring Charlize Theron and James McAvoy. It takes place in Berlin during the cold war revolving around double agents. It's great. Great action scenes, intriguing story line, great music seleciton and cinematography. The trailer is definitely worth a watch. <|endoftext|> Oh, that sounds intriguing. I'd love to see that one pretty soon. I love the sound of cold war as the story-line. I think I'd love it <|endoftext|> Oh awesome! <|endoftext|> Nice one then....I think my next movie is Atomic Blonde <|endoftext|> Yeah it is a great film to watch especially as I imagine you won't have much to do in the coming weeks! I also loved the color that was used in the film, the use of neon lights. Great. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I'm free next week and I'm going to see the movie definitely. Thanks for this awesome recommendation. <|endoftext|> My pleasure! It's directed by David Leitch who has done a number of interesting action/adventure films. Like Deadpool. <|endoftext|> Wow! The same David Leitch who directed the great movie Fast and Furious and Hobbs and Shaw. I love his work. <|endoftext|> Oh great! So you're already familiar with him. He's got an interesting style you'll enjoy. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I'm definitely going to love the recommended movie then. I've always appreciated his works <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hello, how are you <|endoftext|> I am doing well, how are you <|endoftext|> Im great thanks for asking <|endoftext|> of course, Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would be interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> I really like action movies but also like horror films, <|endoftext|> What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie was the one about Harley Queen, that movie was awesome really liked it. <|endoftext|> That is a good movie, I saw that movie as well. I liked the storyline and the new approach they were taking. <|endoftext|> Yeah didnt really liked the Suicide Squad movie, I think the approach they are taking now is much better. <|endoftext|> I would recommend the movie trailer  The Hunt,it has action,and horror and even some comedy! Along with alot of popular actors, like Emma Roberts, Justin Hartley,  Wayne Duvall and Hilary Swank! <|endoftext|> Sounds like a good recommendation can you tell me more about it <|endoftext|> Yes i would love to. 12 strangers wake up in a clearing. Not knowing where they are or how they got there. Ruthless elitists gather at a remote location to hunt humans for sport. But their master plan is about to be derailed when one of the hunted turns the tables back on the elitists. <|endoftext|> Sounds original and I do like the cast, I think I will give this movie a try, what is the year of the movie by the way. <|endoftext|> awesome! 2020 <|endoftext|> Oh so the movie is recent, thats even better although I like old movies as well. <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy this new movie,oldies are always good too! <|endoftext|> Yeah I hope so, I trust your recommendation, thanks a lot <|endoftext|> No problem! <|endoftext|> Hope you have a nice day, Im going to watch that trailer now. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I really liked watching the movie The Leprechaun on St. Patrick's Day. Warwick Davis is highly underrated as an actor. <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting, what was it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a Leprechaun who has his gold stolen and is on a murderous mission to get it back! It also stars Jennifer Aniston and has many comedic moments. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, I've never heard of it but that sounds like something I'd be interested in. I'll have to check it out. <|endoftext|> It's really fun! I heard that Warwick Davis is tied to a sequel for the movie Willow for Disney + but it's been many years since I saw the original. No word on Val Kilmer coming back yet. He's great in everything. <|endoftext|> Oh, I didn't know that. Thank you for the recommendation, I'll be watching that soon. <|endoftext|> Cool! It's nice to dig up old obscure movies, especially since I've seen too much Netlflix <|endoftext|> That's true. I'm always looking for new things to watch. Are there any other movies you would suggest? <|endoftext|> Goon on Netflix is a low-budget comedy movie about a hockey player. It did very poorly at the box office but it's now a cult classic. <|endoftext|> That's a good one, I saw that a while back. I thought it was pretty good but I could see why the ratings wouldn't be great. I still haven't seen the second one. <|endoftext|> I've seen about half of it. Pretty funny, same characters. Need to finish it <|endoftext|> Cool, I'll have to watch that. I enjoy all kinds of movies. Thanks again. <|endoftext|> sure thing, this is fun <|endoftext|> I agree. I've been watching a lot of movies lately so I could use recommendations. <|endoftext|> i can imagine <|endoftext|> If you could only watch one movie for the rest of your life what would it be? <|endoftext|> Forrest gump, you? <|endoftext|> That's tough. I would probably have to say either The Outsiders or The Wolf of Wallstreet. <|endoftext|> ooo those are fun <|endoftext|> I have so many favorites but those stand out to me.

Barnum was when he was a child and how his life was in the 18th century. <|endoftext|> Historical films can feel really immersive when they are good. It's cool to imagine living in a different time.

A good cry. <|endoftext|> Well, if you're into movies with music and like singing, there's plenty of great films for you to also see! <|endoftext|> What would you recommend? <|endoftext|> I would recommend Bohemian Rhapsody <|endoftext|> Yes!

What movie genres are you into? <|endoftext|> I like lots of different genres. I really love a movie that makes you think, maybe a psychological thriller? <|endoftext|> I can think of a lot of great psychological thriller movies that are amazin. Joker is one of them! Have you ever seen it? <|endoftext|> I did see that! I liked it but at the same time thought that it was drug out longer than necessary. <|endoftext|> What did you like and didn't like about the movie? <|endoftext|> I loved the acting it couldn't have been more perfect. I just felt like the story line was slow at times and I lost interest.

I accept that recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> It's a very interesting movie featuring Natalie Portman. <|endoftext|> I have debated watching it many times.

Have you seen any movies lately? <|endoftext|> I have! I recently watched Never Back Down. It came out in 2008. Have you ever watched it? <|endoftext|> Unfortunately, I haven't watched that movie. What about the movie Parasite that recently won an Oscar? <|endoftext|> I have! I've heard about it from a friend and decided to watch it. I never heard about it before because it wasn't a mainstream film. <|endoftext|> Great! What did you like and not like about the movie? <|endoftext|> One thing I liked about the movie was that it tackled present day topics such as class confliction, inequality within society, and wealth disparity. I don't really dislike anything about the movie at all. It's a solid film.\\ <|endoftext|> Great, would you like to watch a similar movie, Joker? <|endoftext|> I will definitely check it out! <|endoftext|> I'm happy you're interested, you won't be disappointed! <|endoftext|> How do you like Joker compared to Parasite? Do you have a favorite between the two? <|endoftext|> I liked them both a lot. It's close but I liked Parasite more because it's different <|endoftext|> Alright, I have added Joker to my watchlist. <|endoftext|> Great! I'm happy I've helped you find a cool new movie! <|endoftext|> Thank you so much for the recommendation! I'll get to it now. <|endoftext|> Have fun! <|endoftext|> You too!

She never really plays the same role twice <|endoftext|> unlike Will Ferrell....who plays the same one every time. fortunately though...i love his roles! they make me laugh so hard. <|endoftext|> Check out the film Stranger Than Fiction!

I won't spoil lol but he's great in it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I hope you're having a good day today. <|endoftext|> Hey! You as well, how's it going?

Depending on the type of movie, I more like action and comedy, but if it's like an uplifting history movie I can definitely be into it! <|endoftext|> I love comedies also! And if you're into action movies, I highly recommend the John Wick series. It is just jammed packed with stuff happening for the first minute right now do the end. <|endoftext|> Okay great! I've heard of those, do you like all of them in the series? There's three, right? <|endoftext|> Yes, there are three. I admit, my favorite is the first one, as is the case with most movie series. However, there are so many great actors and the character development is engaging. I think, too, that most Keanu Reeves films have a certain level of comedy that keeps you coming back for more. <|endoftext|> Cool! Thanks so much for the recommendation, I'll check those out, the first one will be on the top of my list. Thanks! <|endoftext|> Remember, just nonstop action, no chance to lose your attention. I hope you enjoy them! <|endoftext|> Thanks so much, I will! <|endoftext|> John Wick <|endoftext|> Any other good action movies you're excited about that are coming out soon? <|endoftext|> Sorry about that, I put it in the wrong box. Ironically, I don't know when it is expected to release, but I heard they are planning to continue the Matrix series (also Keanu!) <|endoftext|> I heard about that too! Any idea who else is in it? <|endoftext|> I heard that all but the actor that plays Agent Smith are planning to return. I loved him, but I am sure they'll figure something out. Enjoy your day! <|endoftext|> That would be great! He's an awesome actor, thanks so much, enjoy your day too! <|endoftext|> Any other movies you have enjoyed recently? <|endoftext|> I really liked Knives Out! <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! I was totally thrown by the ending to that! I love Christopher Plumber. I heard they're making a second movie with that one too. The only returning actor is Daniel Craig, as the private investigator. <|endoftext|> Oh really? That would be great! I was totally thrown by the twist too. Any other good ones you're excited for? I know a bunch of stuff just moved their release dates. <|endoftext|> No Time to Die, the new James Bond film. I am always a fan of those films. They really do offer something for everyone. Some action, some romance, some thrill. Something nice to look at for everyone. <|endoftext|> Haha, totally! Do you know when it's coming out? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! Can I help recommend a movie trailer for you? <|endoftext|> I would love for you to find me an action movie <|endoftext|> Okay! Do you like real world action, like war movies? Or do you prefer fantasy type action? <|endoftext|> i prefer war movie <|endoftext|> Have you heard of Dunkirk? It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds a war movie about the Allies retreat from France during World War II. <|endoftext|> No, i have not heard of that <|endoftext|> It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds an interesting film. It follows three different story lines to tell its history. I personally like the fighter pilot\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds story. <|endoftext|> Wow, i will definitely try that out <|endoftext|> Tom Hardy is the pilot. Do you know him? He played Bane in the Dark Knight Rises and is the lead in Venom. <|endoftext|> Yes i know Tom Hardy <|endoftext|> Yeah, I think he\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds a great actor. This movie also won 3 oscars, if that helps! <|endoftext|> Yeah it does help <|endoftext|> Also, I just realized Christopher Nolan directed it. He also directed the Dark Knight movies. So, if you like the action in those movie, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm sure you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdd like Dunkirk. <|endoftext|> great i will check them out <|endoftext|> Awesome, the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes are great, too, in case you rely on reviews for movies. <|endoftext|> i will definitely check them out <|endoftext|> Cool! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> yes i did thanks for your time <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> you welcome, do you have any other thing in mind? <|endoftext|> Well, there is another movie I like called War Horse. Ever heard of it? <|endoftext|> Yes i have heard of that <|endoftext|> It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds not so much action, since it follows the horse. But, it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds set in WW I, so there are still many action scenes. <|endoftext|> great and thank you for your time <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, I'd like to know what kind of movies you've recently been watching and what you've been in the mood for <|endoftext|> Hey, how are you? I've been watching a lot of action movies recently. I'd like something that has action, but is also funny. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> Ocean's 11. <|endoftext|> So do you like heist films like Ocean's 11 or just the comedy that was in it? <|endoftext|> I like heist films a lot, and there was some comedy, but I wanted something newer and more funny <|endoftext|> Ah so nothing from like, the 60s or 70s? <|endoftext|> No, I'm not really into that. I want something more new-age. <|endoftext|> Are you more into hard-hitting action like John Wick as well or more ensemble movies like Ocean's? <|endoftext|> I think ensemble movies! I didn't really like John Wick, it was too intense. <|endoftext|> I think you'll enjoy Baby Driver, it's a crime movie and features a star studded cast and a great soundtrack. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, I've heard of that one! Thank you, that sounds good. I'm going to accept that recommendation. <|endoftext|> Thanks! If you want some more action, check out Man from U.N.C.L.E. as well! <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! I've heard of that one, too. Is that with Johnny Depp? <|endoftext|> No, it's got Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. <|endoftext|> Oh, ok yeah. Was that released this year? <|endoftext|> It was a few years back, 2015 release. But yeah, be sure to check Baby Driver out and Man from U.N.C.L.E., the trailer for Baby Driver will be coming up! <|endoftext|> Ok, great! Any more ideas? Maybe something with a female lead? <|endoftext|> Mad Max: Fury Road is a stark contrast from what we've been discussing but I like to think that this movie has one of the strongest female leads, although the film features Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron is a secondary lead who shows a bit of her acting chops in this non-stop action movie. I saw it three times when it was in theatres. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, you must really like it then! I've heard good things about that. It was released in like 2010 right? <|endoftext|> It was also in 2015, I wish I could tell you that it is available on streaming services, but unfortunately it isn't. FX NOW has Baby Driver, by the way! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! What type of movies do you like best? <|endoftext|> Comedy movies are my favorite. They can break up drama in a movie that would otherwise be uninteresting. <|endoftext|> Cool! What are your favorites you've seen? <|endoftext|> Some of my favorites have been Mr and Mrs Smith, The Boundy Hunter, and The Proposal. They can be dramatic or action packed stories but have comedy to break up the tension. I am looking for a recommendation. <|endoftext|> You like action and comedy together. <|endoftext|> Yes. Action and comedy or occasionally Romance and comedies. <|endoftext|> I liked Mr. and Mrs. Smith a lot too when it came out! It was really fun to watch. <|endoftext|> I agree. It was fun with good acting and chemistry between the characters, it had lots of action scenes like the van chase, and it had plenty of comedy throughout all the conversations. <|endoftext|> What's your least favorite genre of movies? <|endoftext|> I dislike country western movies or movies with an old timey feel. It exists before my time so maybe that is why I can't get into it but movies like the Lone Ranger were totally terrible. <|endoftext|> I think you'd like This Means War. It has Tom Hardy in it. I really like him! He was funny in Venom. <|endoftext|> I have not seen that movie, what is it about? Venom was a pretty good movie! I found the comedy pretty funny despite it being a miss for many people. <|endoftext|> It's about two CIA agents finding out that they are dating the same girl, so they try to beat each other. <|endoftext|> Do the characters have good chemistry? Is the comedy in the movie good or does it fall flat? <|endoftext|> Yes, Reese Witherspoon is the main girl. She has really good chemistry with both guys, but the tension between the guys is the funniest part. <|endoftext|> That sounds really good. What year did the movie release? Was it recieved well by viewers? <|endoftext|> It came out in 2012. It got 6.3 out of 10 on IMDB. <|endoftext|> That sounds pretty good. I think I'll check out the movie. I accept your recommendation. Thank you for your help! <|endoftext|> Yay! You're welcome! <|endoftext|> Do you have any other recommendations that I might like since I am here? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, are you looking for a movie? <|endoftext|> Yes <|endoftext|> Im here to help! What type of movie would you like to see? <|endoftext|> Because of Winn Dixie <|endoftext|> Great, that is a wonderful movie for dog-lovers! <|endoftext|> Yes of course! <|endoftext|> Have you seen any other good movies this year? <|endoftext|> Frozen 2 <|endoftext|> Thats a good one, are you planning on going to theaters any time soon? <|endoftext|> No. Because of COVID-19 <|endoftext|> This is the movie you want to see? <|endoftext|> No that is not the movie <|endoftext|> what other type of movie do you have in mind? <|endoftext|> Mary Popins Returns <|endoftext|> Have you already seen this movie? <|endoftext|> No... Not yet <|endoftext|> Did you enjoy the original classic Marry Poppins? <|endoftext|> No... I didn't get a chance to enjoy <|endoftext|> I would recommend seeing the original Marry Poppins as well! <|endoftext|> Thanks a lot. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> horror, love, fantasy <|endoftext|> Hmmm- Do you often go to the movies <|endoftext|> yes, I love going to the movies when they first come out <|endoftext|> Ok So you enjoy opening night <|endoftext|> yes but there are some times that its good to go on the last night that they are in the theater <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you saw <|endoftext|> impractical jokers <|endoftext|> Have you seen Zombieland? <|endoftext|> yes I think it is a great movie, it is very comical <|endoftext|> I Love woody Harrelson- <|endoftext|> Emma Stone is a really good actress, I love how her and her sister keep stealing the boys car <|endoftext|> Yes- Unfortunatly we are all stuck home because of Covid 19 <|endoftext|> I agree but it gives people time to watch movies or netflix, there are some really good movies on netflix and I have all the Harry Potter movies. I love watching them <|endoftext|> Yes- Netflix- I can get caught up on some films i have missed <|endoftext|> There are some good films but also series that are really good, I am watching The Office right now but have watched a number of really good movies and series on Netflix. I loved the show Once Upon a Time it brings back all the disney characters that you knew when you were a kid and is really good. <|endoftext|> I loved the book and I really want to see when I can Call of the Wild <|endoftext|> never seen it but would love to watch it, I like watching new things. I have been trying to watch everything I have watched many random movies and some that you think would suck turned out to be really good movies. <|endoftext|> The movie is based on a novel by Jack London- sometimes the novel does not translate well in the movie- Harrison Ford is a great actor- looking forward to it <|endoftext|> my fiance said that it was a good movie he was telling me some information about it and said that it is a really good movie to watch. I recently just watched Lock and Key on Netflix and it was surprisingly good. I thought that it would be boring but it was really interesting <|endoftext|> I think you should go with your fiance- it will not be boring- and it will give you two to have a nice evening out and not be stuck at home <|endoftext|> Once this whole covid 19 is gone I would love to go watch it. Another one that I really wanted to see in the movies was Fantasy Island that one looked like it would be good. <|endoftext|> Yes once we can get out again- I have seen the Fantasy Island trailer-Also Greyhound with Tom Hanks looks good- <|endoftext|> never heard of greyhound, what did you think of Fantasy Island <|endoftext|> Fantasy Island  sounds like fun- I saw the trailer to that also. The late 70's tv show was very lame- I was a kid then <|endoftext|> movies aren't like they were back when we were younger <|endoftext|> You may like Greyhound it is a true story against the odds theme- <|endoftext|> thank you I accept your recommendation and am excited to watch it <|endoftext|> Cool- you guys have fun <|endoftext|> thanks you too hope this Covid 19 passes and you can get out to the movies. <|endoftext|> Yes in NYC so we are stressed about it- anyway have fun <|endoftext|> I live in New York but I live in the country <|endoftext|> I am going to end chat my side is being glitchy <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> HI. Do you like watching movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, when I have down-time, which I've had a lot of lately. <|endoftext|> I know the feeling. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Last night I watched an old one, The First Wives Club. <|endoftext|> What are your favorite types of movies? <|endoftext|> I prefer romantic comedies, but also like thrillers and mysteries. <|endoftext|> I really like mysteries as well. I'm glad we have movies right now to distract us a little. Have you watched the latest version of Murder on the Orient Express? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't seen that one. I never saw the original either, that I can remember. <|endoftext|> It came out in 2017 but I really liked it. It was very interesting and kept you engaged from the beginning. It also has a great cast. <|endoftext|> Sounds good. I may try to download that one this week. Lately I've just been watching what is on our different streaming services. Who starred in the recent version? <|endoftext|> Penelope Cruz, William Defoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, Josh Gad, Michelle  Pfeiffer. <|endoftext|> That's a pretty good line-up. I will accept your recommendation. Thanks! <|endoftext|> It is available on several streaming services. <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will have no trouble finding it. Thank you. Enjoyed the chat. <|endoftext|> Me too. I hope you enjoy the movie. <|endoftext|> One more thing, did you see the original version before you watched the remake? <|endoftext|> No. I didn't watch the original. This movie stands on its own. <|endoftext|> Ok. Just wondered. I have tried to watch more QUOTATION_MARKclassicsQUOTATION_MARK in my adult life, just to say I have. Thanks again! <|endoftext|> You probably have time to watch both. I might go back and watch the old one as well. <|endoftext|> I definitely have the time now! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hey Im looking for something interesting to watch to pass time do you have any good recommendations? <|endoftext|> What is the last movie that you watched <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was the invisible man have you ever heard of it? <|endoftext|> Not really, what kind of movie is it? <|endoftext|> It's a horror movie. The movie is about a women who is in an abusive relationship with a man who is a computer wiz. She manages to leave him by sneaking away in the night and shortly after a news story breaks that he had committed suicide though she would surely soon find out that was not the case. <|endoftext|> Intense. Have you seen Annihalation or The Gift? <|endoftext|> Yeah its one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. No I havent. <|endoftext|> I would recommend seeing the trailer for The Gift.

It's about a scientist that goes on a secret expedition. Their discovery leads to a series of events that change the people around them. <|endoftext|> Interesting. I think that sounds more my taste. <|endoftext|> Great. Natalie Portman is in this movie. She is amazing in this movie. There are some beautiful scenes and suspense interactions in this movie! <|endoftext|> Oh I love her! Double plus. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Hope you enjoy the trailer. <|endoftext|> Just watched the trailer definitely something I'd be into <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi! <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> are seeking for a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> yes i am <|endoftext|> what type of trailer you want? <|endoftext|> i want action movies <|endoftext|> Oh!,i'm also like action movies <|endoftext|> that's good <|endoftext|> Are you recently see spiderman movie <|endoftext|> yes i have seen the spiderman <|endoftext|> Will you miss Iron man in movies? <|endoftext|> yes really <|endoftext|> In action movies which movie is your favorite? <|endoftext|> i have seen the hellboy <|endoftext|> Ok,it's good movie.Who is your favorite hero? <|endoftext|> none really <|endoftext|> What is your opinion about Harry parter series? <|endoftext|> it is really great <|endoftext|> thank you <|endoftext|> you welcome <|endoftext|> Did you watch jason bourne? <|endoftext|> no i did not <|endoftext|> shall i send this one for you? <|endoftext|> yes please <|endoftext|> thank you so much for your interest <|endoftext|> you welcome <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi, I recently just watched QUOTATION_MARKThe AnimalQUOTATION_MARK and The murder mystery movie. <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see <|endoftext|> I am usually looking for comedy movies or serious movies that have some deep meaning or great action movies. <|endoftext|> Wow. That seems like a broad range of movies. Do you have a favorite actress or actor? <|endoftext|> I like Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Will Smith, Mila Kunis <|endoftext|> I got some great choices for you. Uncut Gems with Adams Sandler, On the serious side Joker, if your looking for an action packed movie The commuter with Liam Neeson. The Commuter is my personal favorite. <|endoftext|> Trailer of The Commuter looks great I would definitely check that out. <|endoftext|> Yeah. I remember you stated you also like action movies! <|endoftext|> Do you other similar movies? <|endoftext|> Those are my favorite genres Comedy, Action, Drama. No particular order <|endoftext|> Have you seen flight plan, the animal or the murder mystery. <|endoftext|> Got it. The Animal. Funny movie. <|endoftext|> Yep, do you any other similar movie that you have seen and loved <|endoftext|> Similar the Animal? <|endoftext|> Yes or to the murder mystery something that has comedy and is serious at the same time <|endoftext|> Have you watched the Gift or Get Out <|endoftext|> Yes I have watched both of those movies. <|endoftext|> How about Nocturnal Animals or Gone Girl? <|endoftext|> I have seen Gone girl but not Nocturnal Animals I will watch that trailer. Thanks for the recomendation I like it. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer <|endoftext|> Yes I will like to watch that trailer <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Dear Sir/Mam I'm here to recommend a movie trailer to you. How are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm great thank you for asking! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movies you like? <|endoftext|> I just watched Knives Out last night and thought it was really good! I like movies that aren't predictable and have a combination of comedy and action. <|endoftext|> Darn I haven't seen that one. Hmm, let me think unpredictable action comedy... <|endoftext|> I also saw Snowpiercer the day before and liked it a lot - more than Parasite. <|endoftext|> Yea, Snowpiercer had some real speed to it. Though both it and Parasite had very pretty cinematography. Do you prefer that prettier more artistic style to a blockbuster action like the new Mission Impossible? <|endoftext|> It depends on how I'm feeling in the moment but I usually go for more light hearted films that are easy to digest. <|endoftext|> Ahh for a moment I was thinking maybe you'd be interested in another Bong Joon-ho film. The Host is more action packed a 'la Snowpiercer but it does have some white-knuckled horror moments. <|endoftext|> I would be interested! What is The Host about? <|endoftext|> When toxic waste and American hegemony collide nature(?) produces a monster that puts innocent people at risk. Working together a family must ... <|endoftext|> That makes me want to learn more about it. I'll definitely look more into it and watch the trailers, etc. I accept your recommendation :). <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you enjoy it. Nice chatting. <|endoftext|> Are there any actors I would recognize in The Host? <|endoftext|> Kang-ho Song the father from Parasite also in Snowpiercer is in the movie. <|endoftext|> That's great! I love his acting. You mentioned that it has bits of horror but should I be expecting any jump scares? <|endoftext|> Yes there are a couple of those to start things off with some anxiety. <|endoftext|> How graphic does the movie get? My partner doesn't like really gory scenes so would it be a movie to avoid watching with him? <|endoftext|> I think they might want to avoid it if they are anti gore/monster. Tho I don't remember exceptionally graphic scenes as much as the pretty camera work showing people in the town going about life before _it_ all starts going down. <|endoftext|> I can watch the trailer with him and see if it's something I should watch with someone else or with him. Thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Grr, their system doesn't seem to include The Host (2006) so I'll just send along the link to another of his films Okja and hope you can find your way to it from there :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I am doing well, what about you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing good! What kind of movies do you like lately? <|endoftext|> I am interested in action and comedy. I also like rom coms. <|endoftext|> That's a pretty cool range. What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Last movie I watched was 6 underground. <|endoftext|> Do you like big name actors like Ryan Reynolds <|endoftext|> Yes, I think he is a good actor. I prefer to watch actors who's work I am familiar  with. <|endoftext|> What did you like in that movie, or other movies in general other than actors? <|endoftext|> It's packed with action and comedy, which made me happy. There was some gory scenes but overall the actions scenes were amazing! I like movies that have a good story line and can transport me. <|endoftext|> One movie I really loved that was an amazing action comedy, and even had Ryan Reynolds, was Deadpool! <|endoftext|> Yeah I totally agree! <|endoftext|> It's a great movie that even has sequels as well. <|endoftext|> Yes I watched both movies already and enjoyed both. Both equally good in my opinion. <|endoftext|> That's great to hear. Would you be open to me recommending it to you again? Are you someone who enjoys rewatching a movie they loved already? <|endoftext|> I do like rewatching movies, however I am in the mood to watch something new and exciting. Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Have you heard of the Hitman's Bodyguard? It's a great action comedy film and highly rated! <|endoftext|> I haven't watched that one. I think I am interested. <|endoftext|> Great, I will recommend this trailer to you to watch now. <|endoftext|> Sounds good to me. I will watch it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi, thanks for your help <|endoftext|> No Problem!

A QUOTATION_MARKfeel goodQUOTATION_MARK movie. <|endoftext|> Aww, I loved his show when I was younger. I actually think I'd like to see that movie. <|endoftext|> I was thinking about this movie trailer because he does have a major cultural impact on America and fits how you like drama movies and I am sure it is fun and humorous <|endoftext|> I think it's a good recommendation <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure, I'll watch it <|endoftext|> Thank you! Hope you have a great day! <|endoftext|> you too, thanks! <|endoftext|> So I guess we have more to talk about, lol <|endoftext|> Maybe I have to say I accept the recommendation? I accept the recommendation. lol <|endoftext|> We should be almost done. I am hoping to see this movie plus the new Star Wars, how about you? <|endoftext|> I'm not really into sci fi that much. There haven't been too many movies I wanted to see in theaters this year. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched in theater? I just saw Frozen 2 with my family. <|endoftext|> I think the last movie was Us <|endoftext|> Nice! Thank you again for taking my recommendation.

What is it about> <|endoftext|> It's a horror movie about a camgirl, does that sound interesting to you? <|endoftext|> Not really. I don't really like POV movies <|endoftext|> It is seen from the third person perspective if that's what you mean. <|endoftext|> Oh. I see. What other netflix movies do you reccomend? <|endoftext|> I'm not sure if it's still on Netflix, but Killer Klowns from Outer Space is my other favorite horror movie. <|endoftext|> Wow! I really like that movie. It is very old. I had it on DVD. <|endoftext|> Ah! So you've seen it. What about Get Out? <|endoftext|> I saw Get Out in theaters. It was very interesting.

Have you seen Deadpool 2? <|endoftext|> I have seen the first one! <|endoftext|> The second one is even better! They got Celine Dion to banter with him, and it's hilarious! <|endoftext|> I bet it is. I havent seen it yet. Can you tell me if ryan reynalds is in it? <|endoftext|> Yes, he is the main character, Deadpool. He has a few other actors supporting him, and they are all very funny.

Funny action or just straight-up action? <|endoftext|> Just like any action movie, but I'd like one with more action kind of like Fast and Furious <|endoftext|> Ok, I got you now.

I'm kind of afraid of the romance part (for me it always drag down a movie when it don't serve the story good. But ill check it <|endoftext|> The romance part of it was towards the end of the movie, that was the plot twist. Ansel Elgort did real good in the movie <|endoftext|> we don't see him in too much movie though. I wonder why. <|endoftext|> I think he stars in a movie each year <|endoftext|> oh yeah I've seen that in IMDB but not the big profile one. Thanks for the help ;) <|endoftext|> Insurgent is another good movie to see <|endoftext|> I watched it. Liked the 1st one but the 2nd one is like any other YA movies.

I am looking for a movie to stream about espionage. I female leads like for example Nikita. <|endoftext|> Okay, very cool! Have you seen Red Sparrow with Dominika Egorova? <|endoftext|> I did see it! It is a great movie. It was fascinating. I believed it is based on a lot of fact about how Russians prepare their spies. Well all spy agencies I am sure do something that is similar. What too was interesting was the interaction between the lead character and her relative, a male, and how she was manipulated to become a spy. How about another recommendation. That one was great! <|endoftext|> That is awesome and yes it is a good one. Well if you liked Red Sparrow, I would recommend Bridge of Spies! <|endoftext|> Yes Bridge of Spies I don't believe I saw that movie. I will check it out, Where is it streaming? <|endoftext|> It is available on YouTube Vudu, and Google Play <|endoftext|> OK thanks I will check out those sources. Do you have any other recommendations? I am especially interested in actors who are well known and popular; i.e. Robert Redford, Tom Hanks and so forth. <|endoftext|> Tom Hanks is the star in Bridge of Spies! But I would also recommend All is Lost if you like Robert Redford. <|endoftext|> All is Lost no I did not see it. I just checked online it's not really what I am looking for but I will check it out anyway. I definitely want to see movies about espionage. I can not wait for example to see the next episode of Homeland on Showtime. I am always looking for another good spy movie. what's the FBI series, the one where the female lead wakes up nude in Times Square with a lot of tatoos? <|endoftext|> I am not familiar with that movie <|endoftext|> It's a TV series. I like those too. Well maybe there's a spy film that came out in 2019. Can you recommend a new release? <|endoftext|> I would recommend Anna for 2019 spy movies. <|endoftext|> Yeh, yeh I like that reommendation. I saw Hanna at least I think I watched that movie or TV series. I will have to check on both Anna and Hanna. Good, good that's great. We came up with two Bridge of Spies and Anna and I will watch again Hanna.

I comes out in June but it is a must see film. Especially if you are a Top Gun fan <|endoftext|> what is this movie about? i see that is interesting but I can see their essence <|endoftext|> This movie picks up years later after Top Gun. Tom Cruise is back as Maverick. The movie trailer is very nostalgic of the original Top Gun. <|endoftext|> in the movie are another famous actor <|endoftext|> Yes,  Val Kilmer is also back in this movie! <|endoftext|> and in which part of the time is the movie, like say the movie was inspired en 1995, something like that <|endoftext|> I believe this movie is present day. <|endoftext|> ahhh okay, and in which country was recorded the movie <|endoftext|> This is an American made movie. <|endoftext|> and the last question do you think that this movie will win an oscar? <|endoftext|> There is a great chance it could win in either director, cinemagraphy, or music. <|endoftext|> ohh i think that i will see this movie thank you for this recomendation! <|endoftext|> You're welcome! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello!

Have you watched the movie \"Breakthrough\". It is a tear jerker. <|endoftext|> No its a drama, that doesn't match what I like to watch <|endoftext|> Do you like National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, it is an oldie, but good one to me? <|endoftext|> Yes I want to watch that movie <|endoftext|> Oh my, it is hilarious. You have got to watch it.

I think they are getting too old to. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you find a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> I'd like a recommendation please! <|endoftext|> What is your favorite movie genre? <|endoftext|> I love sci-fi movies. <|endoftext|> Me too! What is the last one you watched? <|endoftext|> I'm a huge fan of the Marvel series. I think End Game was the last one I saw in theaters. <|endoftext|> Awesome! I loved the way they ended the series. Do you like movies that are stand-alone or in a series better? <|endoftext|> I'm torn between both. I love a good continuation plot. But the standalone series are great too. <|endoftext|> I love how the stand-alone Marvel movies feed in to the larger series plot. Would you like to see a new movie similar to these or something different? <|endoftext|> I would! I would love to see a new Marvel series. I fell in love with the characters. <|endoftext|> Have you had a chance to see Captain Marvel yet? I would highly recommend it for you if you haven't! <|endoftext|> I accept that recommendation! I have seen it. I love Brie Larson. <|endoftext|> Great! She is an acting powerhouse. <|endoftext|> Yes, she is. I missed her in End Game though. She didn't get a ton of screen time, and I think that was a mistake. She's terrific. <|endoftext|> I totally agree, her character could have helped the team in such a significant way if they had let her. I get that they wanted to focus on ending the old timeline, though. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I get that too. But I think if her character was allowed to have been there beforehand, maybe a couple of the character would have survived. I'm still so sad that we lost so many of my favorites. <|endoftext|> It was heartbreaking. I think I was sobbing in the theater throughout the whole movie. <|endoftext|> So was I. Iron Man broke me. I was in a complete inconsolable mess. <|endoftext|> You sound just like my friends and I! I will send you over that trailer. <|endoftext|> Thank you so much! I really appreciate it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, Can I help you find a movie? <|endoftext|> Yes! I'm looking for a good horror movie. <|endoftext|> One of my favs too. Do you like scary movies with killing? <|endoftext|> I'm definitely okay with it but I cringe away from excessive gore. <|endoftext|> You might  like Knives Out. Its currently playing and has Daniel Craig in the lead <|endoftext|> What type of horror movie is it? Is it more of a thriller or a psychological horror film? <|endoftext|> I would say psycological thriller <|endoftext|> that's my favorite genre. You said it's in theaters now? <|endoftext|> yes it is <|endoftext|> How often does the movie rely on jump scares to make it a scary movie? Those can get boring and predictable <|endoftext|> it doesnt look like it. more of head games <|endoftext|> Oh that's great. What is the main character like? <|endoftext|> He is a little mysterious, likes hes hiding somehing <|endoftext|> He's untrustworthy? <|endoftext|> He seems to be <|endoftext|> Are there any women in the movie? I think having diversity in a main cast is important <|endoftext|> Oh yes. Jaime Lee Curtis. She had done amazing work in this genre <|endoftext|> Awesome! I'm going to try to see Knives Out soon. Thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great.

It's pretty cool watching his transition from wrestler to full on movie actor <|endoftext|> its amazing but the being in the field of  acting  really matches him lot better <|endoftext|> oh yeah for sure. I think the new Jumanji movie will be pretty awesome. I was pretty impressed with the last one <|endoftext|> yap so true. his body amaze me for his age <|endoftext|> No kidding!

I think my kids would like that. <|endoftext|> If they enjoyed the original this one should sure be a treat. <|endoftext|> Have you seen it or is it not out yet <|endoftext|> Its in theaters now <|endoftext|> Excellent. I will accept your recommendation and I will click done now. <|endoftext|> Sounds great. I hope you have a lovely time at the theater! <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|> Your very welcome <|endoftext|> I will wait until Thanksgiving to go there <|endoftext|> You won't regret it! <|endoftext|> Frozen is a good movie to see during the holiday <|endoftext|> I agree <|endoftext|> Plus Disney has a great reputation of providing highly rated children movies <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good morning. Can I help with a movie selection? <|endoftext|> good morning,  I really like mysteries and horror movies but I stay open minded to new movies <|endoftext|> What are some that you've seen and really liked? <|endoftext|> I've watched Malevolence 3 and currently watching a series called Castle Rock. <|endoftext|> I loved the Malevolence movies. I have not started the Castle Rock yet. <|endoftext|> Just started Castle Rock yesterday and I was glued. It has a great plot. <|endoftext|> I've been watching the Prodigy and a Handmaiden's tale <|endoftext|> Sounds like some good movies. I'm gonna look these up and watch this week. There are several movies called Prodigy. Which one? <|endoftext|> Prodigy is actually a Hulu tv show. It's a bit like Criminal Minds but the star is the son of a famous serial killer. There's another movie that looks kinteresting called Se7en. It's loaded with stars like Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. Serial killings based on the 7 deadly sins <|endoftext|> Yes Se7en sounds like my type of movie. Gonna watch this one today. I am a fan of crime investigations and serial killer documentaries as well. <|endoftext|> Great. Me too. <|endoftext|> I recommend a great movie called The Cleansing Hour. It has a twist to it. <|endoftext|> That's brand new. Looks interesting. <|endoftext|> Its one of those movies that has a good spiritual message but still has the modern day internet users as part of the story. It has lots of blood and gore. Beware. <|endoftext|> Yikes. The Lodge looks interesting. Mixes horror with some comedy so you can sleep at night. <|endoftext|> This sound great. I've heard of this movie before. I like to laugh during movies also. As long as its not to silly. <|endoftext|> Looking at \"Regression\" with Emma Watson. A detective investigating a cult. <|endoftext|> Now that's up my alley on mystery. Great recommendation <|endoftext|> It's been out for a while but looks good. <|endoftext|> Yes, came out in 2016 but the year doesn't make the movie old to me. I'm gonna watch it and add to my movie list for future watching if I really love it. <|endoftext|> Great. Hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm here to help you chose a movie! <|endoftext|> Terrific <|endoftext|> What are some genres you like? What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> the last movie i saw in the theater was QUOTATION_MARKHustlersQUOTATION_MARK . I generally like comedy, drama and documentaries <|endoftext|> How did you like QUOTATION_MARKHustlersQUOTATION_MARK? It definitely has the drama aspect, did it leave you wanting more or was it not exactly what you were looking for? <|endoftext|> I liked it,  it wasn't the most high-brow movie i've ever seen but it was fun. I like to just enjoy <|endoftext|> And what are your thoughts on action in film? <|endoftext|> I like some action. Just not too violent <|endoftext|> Definitely, movies like QUOTATION_MARKDeadpoolQUOTATION_MARK wouldn't be up your alley I'm guessing? <|endoftext|> It could be. I understand Deadpool was very funny  I like funny <|endoftext|> Haha it definitely was, I think I have a suggestion for you though <|endoftext|> Cool  Whats that? <|endoftext|> So it's the newQUOTATION_MARKA Beautiful Day in the NeighborhoodQUOTATION_MARK, the Mr. Rogers movie with Tom Hanks as the actor. It's not as much a comedic relief, but I saw it in theatres with my roomates and it's honestly a super refreshing and incredibly well directed movie. <|endoftext|> that sounds so good to me. I loved Mr. Rogers so much.. and Tom Hanks is a great actor <|endoftext|> The combination is incredible to be honest, and it lets you understand his background and who he was as a person so much more <|endoftext|> That sounds amazing. I would love to see that <|endoftext|> Awesome, that's my recommendation then! <|endoftext|> Great! That is totally what i'm going to see. I can't wait to watch the trailer <|endoftext|> The trailer's awesome and it's even better in theater <|endoftext|> Well then. Given the opportunity I will formally accept. Thank you so much for your help <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. My name is Becca. I'm here to help you find a movie trailer today. Would you mind starting by telling me your name? <|endoftext|> Hey Becca! I'm Erica <|endoftext|> Hi Erica. It's so nice to meet you! <|endoftext|> Thank you - you as well! Can you help me find a movie? <|endoftext|> I will try my best! What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Skyscraper ! <|endoftext|> Oh that movie was awesome! I love The Rock. <|endoftext|> You've seen it?! It was SO good. I've actually seen it a few times. What was your favorite part? <|endoftext|> I'm a tech nerd so the specs about the actual building, and then watching the tour of the building was amazing. The architecture was so detailed. <|endoftext|> It was ! I loved how they showed detail about the massive building as well. It truly was a beautiful building. Have you seen any good movies that are similar to Skyscraper? <|endoftext|> Yes. I know of two big ones. They are a few years old. One is San Andreas which also features The Rock, and the other is any of the Die Hard movies. <|endoftext|> I've honestly never seen any of the Die Hard movies. What are they about? <|endoftext|> The first one is about a man who is an NYPD officer. He has to save his wife and other hostages being held at Nakatomi Plaza in LA. There are lots of scenes with impossible rescues, and tons of action. <|endoftext|> That actually sounds really good! I'll have to check them out! Thank you so much for the recommendation <|endoftext|> My pleasure. I just know you'll love them, and they are great if you love binge watching or weekend movie marathons. <|endoftext|> I hope so! I've been looking for something to binge watch lately! Sounds like I'll have some great binge worthy movies ! <|endoftext|> I have the trailer available for you to watch as well. <|endoftext|> Oh sure, I'd love to see it! Who plays the main character? <|endoftext|> A much younger Bruce Willis <|endoftext|> Ohh I love Bruce Willis ! He is such a great actor <|endoftext|> He really is. I feel like he's what The Rock studied when he started acting. They had similar styles at the beginning. <|endoftext|> Very interesting ! Well, I'm gonna go check it out! Thank you again for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Of course. I hope you enjoy it.:) <|endoftext|> Hope so ! Enjoy your day!(: <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, Do you like movies a lot? <|endoftext|> I do. I watch movies pretty often. Do you like movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, Family are my favorite and drama. What is your favorite type of movie? <|endoftext|> I like all sorts of movies like documentaries, comedies, scary movies, thrillers, dramas. <|endoftext|> Wow, I think I know a movie you may like. <|endoftext|> Okay. What do you recommend? <|endoftext|> A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood telling the story of Mr. Rogers is beautiful and eloqunt. <|endoftext|> I wanted to see that! Is that the one with Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers. <|endoftext|> Yes, Tom Hanks looks just like him in the movie. The resemblence is uncanny. <|endoftext|> I appreciate and accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great I really hope you enjoy the movie. I can't wait to see it too. <|endoftext|> Do you know when it comes out in theaters? Or is it already out? <|endoftext|> It came out November 22, 2019 in the US <|endoftext|> Oh okay. That is helpful. Did you see the documentary about Mr. Rogers that came out this past year? <|endoftext|> Yes, that was heartwarming as well. I love his genuine passion for loving people. <|endoftext|> Did you watch the show as a child? <|endoftext|> Yes, I even met Mr. McFeeley once. That was exciting :) <|endoftext|> You did?! That is very exciting. <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> I will! Thank you again. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there <|endoftext|> Hi! I'm looking for recommendations on a great holiday movie, do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> For sure! First, do you have certain preferences or aversions? Like are you into musicals? <|endoftext|> I do not really like musicals. <|endoftext|> Good to know... I would have recommended White Christmas, it's a classic and a bit of a tradition in our family, but there are so many to choose from! The old Tim Allen Santa Clause movie is super fun and so is Home Alone. <|endoftext|> Is the Tim Allen Santa Clause movie funny? I would love to watch a funny movie. <|endoftext|> Yes it is! It's a heart warming family comedy :) <|endoftext|> I accept this recommendation and would love to watch it with my family! Thank you for your help. <|endoftext|> You're very welcome! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> If we finish this movie early, do you have children's Christmas movie to recommend? So far our favorite is Elf. <|endoftext|> I would absolutely recommend QUOTATION_MARKRise of the GuardiansQUOTATION_MARK it's a kid's movie, but definitely funny so adults can enjoy too <|endoftext|> I never knew Rise of the Guardian's Christmas movie. I'm sure we would love this recommendation too. <|endoftext|> It's honestly kind of an all holiday theme. There's stuff in there about the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy and other characters like that. But there's definitely a dominant Christmas theme in it. <|endoftext|> That's wonderful thank you for letting me know. Both of these movies seem like a great fit for my family. Thank you for your recommendations. <|endoftext|> You're welcome! I hope you enjoy them. Happy Holidays to you and your family <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|> Besides Elf, do you have any other favorites? <|endoftext|> We really love Jim Carrey's How The Grinch Stole Christmas. It really makesmusnStole Christmas. It really makes us laugh and he took on the character so well. Have you ever seen it? <|endoftext|> I have! It's been several years though. I always liked the original cartoon, but I can agree that Jim Carrey's performance was awesome and he really made it his own <|endoftext|> I agree! Thank you for again for chatting with me and sending your recommendations. Happy holidays. <|endoftext|> Thanks you too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> What was the latest movie that you've watched? <|endoftext|> the last movie that i have watched is the irishman, which i loved <|endoftext|> What did you like most about it? <|endoftext|> scorcese, deniro, pesci, and pacino always do an excellent job when portraying as the mob <|endoftext|> I agree, they are all great actors. <|endoftext|> anything with scorsese i usually enjoy <|endoftext|> I do too! I loved seeing him in Guilty by Suspicion. <|endoftext|> that is a deniro film that I actually have not seen yer <|endoftext|> Scorsese plays a part in it as well. I think you may like it. <|endoftext|> what is it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a Hollywood director (De Niro) that returns from France only to find out that the FBI and the House Committee on Un-American Activities is interested in him. <|endoftext|> that actually does sound interesting, i will accept that recommendation <|endoftext|> Great! I really think you will enjoy it! <|endoftext|> thank! take care <|endoftext|> You as well! <|endoftext|> ya, i will watch it as soon as i can <|endoftext|> Best wishes and happy holidays. <|endoftext|> you too! happy holidays <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I hear that you are seeking a movie recommendation. Tell me about your movie preferences? <|endoftext|> I like action adventure and horror movies. <|endoftext|> Oh nice! Me too! I've recently watched The Ring, have you heard of it? It's really old, from 2002 I believe. It was a movie I watched as a kid. <|endoftext|> I heard of it and I think I watched it a while back but it was so long ago. I think they did remake a more recent version of it, did you watch the remake of it? <|endoftext|> No, I don't believe I've seen a remake. I think there was a sequel that came out a while back, but that's as far as I've gone with this. What recent movies have you seen? Have you seen Zombieland? Not sure if that's a horror movie, though. Sure sounds like it. <|endoftext|> I recently watched the new Halloween with michael myers and Anabelle. I haven't seen Zombieland but I think its a comedy if im correct. What horror movies would you suggest watching that came out in 2019? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Annabelle Comes Homes? Something about a haunted doll always gives me chills. <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one, I might check it out. I saw the first one. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would like to watch the trailer. <|endoftext|> Here is a link to the trailer. <|endoftext|> It looks better than the first anabelle. I will def check this one out. <|endoftext|> I know you said you liked action adventure and horror, I guess we jumped right to it. I can recommend an action adventure movie as well if you'd like. <|endoftext|> I am open to hear. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Angel Has Fallen. I am a big fan of Gerard Butler. <|endoftext|> No, I haven't heard of that movie before. Is it any good? <|endoftext|> I have not seen that one, but I know it came out this year. It is actually a movie that I plan on watching since it is a sequel to a movie that I have seen and really loved called Olympus Has Fallen, which had a very dystopian type theme. <|endoftext|> I think I would want to watch it to see if it is good. <|endoftext|> I think it would be better to watch the first of the Fallen movies, which is Olympus Had Fallen even though it is old, but if you end up liking it, you can then watch the movie that came out this year. How does that sound? <|endoftext|> I agree, the movie before might set the tone and help me better undersand Angel has fallen. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hey! what's up? <|endoftext|> Just looking for a good movie! Seen any? <|endoftext|> i've watched some stuff. there's been a lot of christmas movies on TV. <|endoftext|> Which one is your favorite, and why? <|endoftext|> i like The Year Without a Santa Claus. it's old-fashioned and cute; brings back good memories. <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you dislike? <|endoftext|> i think action movies are boring; i don't care for romance either. <|endoftext|> I think action movies are boring, too! I do like horror. And romance is played out. <|endoftext|> horror movies are fun <|endoftext|> I watched one recently called Greta. It's about an old lady. <|endoftext|> what's the premise? <|endoftext|> An old lady manipulates people into coming to visit her, and horror ensues. <|endoftext|> interesting. would you recommend it? is there anyone noteworthy in it? <|endoftext|> Chloe Grace Moretz is in it. She was on Desperate Housewives. <|endoftext|> she looks very familiar. i'm sure i've seen her in something. is the movie scary in a QUOTATION_MARKboo!QUOTATION_MARK way or scary in a chilling way? <|endoftext|> It's both. <|endoftext|> ha. jump scares are cheap, but i guess it's all a part of the fun. i'll accept the recommendation. <|endoftext|> I see you like horror and Christmas, would you like to see a trailer combining both? <|endoftext|> even better; i would love to. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> yes, i will accept the recommendation and watch the trailer. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> well I like action movies. what could you recommend? <|endoftext|> Personally I would watch Atomic Blonde. This movie was full of action. <|endoftext|> I saw. It was OK but kinda strange... I liked Lucy more. That was awesome. Got anything else? <|endoftext|> Mission Impossible is enjoying. Tom Cruise was great in this film. <|endoftext|> MI:10? ;) I like him, but I think I've seen one too many. BTW if you are not a bot, say Ssup. <|endoftext|> I have some great movies that I can refer you to. That is my current job. <|endoftext|> OK then... Well can you refer me to the latest Terminator movie or something? <|endoftext|> The latest Terminator movie is Terminator: Dark Fate. <|endoftext|> I know that... Do you recommend it or not? <|endoftext|> Yes <|endoftext|> OK I kinda gave it to you :) Can you recommend something in the same style? <|endoftext|> Joker is a great film. <|endoftext|> Yes! I agree. I missed in the theaters. Really want to see it on Bluray. Can you tell me the main gist without giving away too much? <|endoftext|> Joker is a movie about a guy named Arthur Fleck who becomes mad and transforms into a criminal mastermind named Joker. <|endoftext|> OK I am excited. So are you alive or are you an algorithm <|endoftext|> Im human. So would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Awesome. yes I'd like to see the trailer <|endoftext|> Okay that sounds awesome. <|endoftext|> So how do we wrap this up? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> What can I help you wih <|endoftext|> Can you help recommend a movie trailer to watch? <|endoftext|> I would recommend horror movies, but I would like to know what movies you like first <|endoftext|> Oh, I love action movies. <|endoftext|> The types with very serious actors (Stallone, etc) or, like Guardians of the Galaxy? <|endoftext|> I like both, but I'm looking for something super hero related, like Guardians of the Galaxy. <|endoftext|> Oh! I have a few ideas of what you have in mind. Are comic book characters interesting at all? <|endoftext|> Yes! I love comic book characters, like Spider man, Ironman and Captain America. <|endoftext|> Okay. Would you like to watch this trailer for the Avengers? <|endoftext|> Oh that would be great! <|endoftext|> I haven't actually watched it yet. It is the one with that Thanos character and the Justice league, right? <|endoftext|> No, the Justice League is not in this movie, but Thanos sure is. <|endoftext|> I'm a fan! I hope it's a good trailer. <|endoftext|> It should be, these superhero mashups have been great so far. <|endoftext|> And the new Joker has been all meme'd up, but I haven't heard much about it. Do you like those movies at all? <|endoftext|> Yes I watch all of those movies, I actually just watched Joker and it was fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix did an awesome job portraying the Joker. <|endoftext|> It's about time for a new TMNT for realsies or a grimey comic character, and plus in the comic universe, how many times has Gambit had a starring role? I think they skipped him. <|endoftext|> I heard he was supposed to get a movie, but that was before Disney bought out Fox. I'm not so into TMNT anymore, I stopped watching them when I was a kid. <|endoftext|> The nostalgia and filmography in like the Mario movies in the 90s had a certain style that was masked over recently. I can't remember which films. <|endoftext|> Movies in the 90's were great. I still remember a movie called The Wizard, but I think it came out in 1989. Anyways thanks for the Avengers trailer recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> hello how are you? <|endoftext|> I am well. What is your preference when it comes to movies? <|endoftext|> i like dramas, crime, scifi, comedies <|endoftext|> oh nice. me to. whats the latest movie you've seen <|endoftext|> i just saw the irishman and it was awesome <|endoftext|> hmm I havent seen that one. Have you seen the joker? <|endoftext|> no but, it looks really good <|endoftext|> It is amazing. I think you'll enjoy it since you like drama and comedy <|endoftext|> it sounds pretty good i would like to see it <|endoftext|> yes, I definitely recommend it <|endoftext|> i would be happy to accept the recommendation <|endoftext|> sound good. Im sure you'll enjoy it <|endoftext|> who is the main actor? <|endoftext|> Joaquin Phoenix and he did a great job <|endoftext|> when does this take place now or in the past? <|endoftext|> in the past. it explains what led him to become the joker <|endoftext|> cool i cant wait to see it, thank you <|endoftext|> good. you'll enjoy it <|endoftext|> thank you for the recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are ya?! <|endoftext|> I'm good, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm well.

Do you have any movie recommendations? <|endoftext|> You can say that again, I am too! I could definitely try to point ya in the right direction! What kind of movies are you into? <|endoftext|> Cool! I mainly like drams and comedy. This time of year I love Christmas movies. <|endoftext|> You can never watch too many Christmas movies around the holidays. There's a new movie that just came out actually, it's called QUOTATION_MARKLast ChristmasQUOTATION_MARK with Emilia Clarke! She's a great actress in my opinion! <|endoftext|> What's it about? She sounds familiar. <|endoftext|> It's a romantic comedy! She works as an elf every year at the store and meets a boy who turns her world upside down. Perfect holiday movie! <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! I actually mentioned that one to my wife. We ended up seeing Playing With Fire instead...hated it. I think we'll see Last Christmas! <|endoftext|> I thought Playing With Fire was interesting! But good choice, give the trailer a look! <|endoftext|> Yeah, I definitely will. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> Of course, enjoy! <|endoftext|> What did you like about Playing With Fire? <|endoftext|> I love John Cena, he's corny but it works for him! <|endoftext|> I love Cena too. I'm a huge wrestling fan (The Rock is a better actor). I've like his other stuff, but this one just dragged for me. <|endoftext|> Dwayne Johnson is awesome! I love him and Kevin Hart. What do you mean, dragged? <|endoftext|> Rock and Kevin Hart are awesome together!

How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm great. I'm looking for some movie recommendations. My favorite kind of movies, is mostly drama but I also like comedy as well. <|endoftext|> What is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was A Dog's Journey and I absolutely loved it. It was such a fantastic and heartwarming movie. <|endoftext|> Perfect! So do you want a movie with a similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> I would love to find a movie with somewhat of a similar story, it was just so good, I would be very interested in watching something simliar. <|endoftext|> I recommend you to watch The Art of Racing in the Rain <|endoftext|> Cool can you tell me a little bit about ti? <|endoftext|> Denny Swift is a Formula One race car driver who understands that the techniques needed on the racetrack can also be used to successfully navigate everyday life.

What kind of movie and movie trailers do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> I really enjoy comedies, nothing too cheesy though. <|endoftext|> I feel that, sometimes cheesy movies feel like they're trying to hard to be funny. What's that last good movie that you watched? It can include a movie you watched at home or at the theater. <|endoftext|> I watched Wine Country with Amy Poehler. That was pretty funny, but a little girly for my tastes. <|endoftext|> Oooh, I haven't seen that one, I'll have to check it out! Are you interested in seeing a movie that's similar to Wine Country, or something different- perhaps less girly? <|endoftext|> I'd prefer something less girly, so no rom coms. <|endoftext|> Okay, got it!

Leslie had such great comedic timing. <|endoftext|> Yes, he's a classic. I think Will Ferrell is a lot like him. Both have that comedic presense. <|endoftext|> Would you be interested in watching Anchorman? <|endoftext|> I've seen that one, and it's great! I've probably watched it a dozen times. Anything like that would be great! <|endoftext|> Okay, awesome! Have you seen The Campaign? That's another great and funny movie with Will Ferrell in it <|endoftext|> I haven't seen that one!

It is amazing and gritty. I highly recommend it. <|endoftext|> No, ive actually never even heard of it. What genre is it? <|endoftext|> It is a drama. What was the movie you saw over the weekend? <|endoftext|> I took my daughter to see Frozen 2 with my husband. <|endoftext|> Cool, I was thinking of seeing that myself. How was it? <|endoftext|> It was better than we could have expected, I think i even like it more than the first. Definitely cant wait until we can buy it. <|endoftext|> That;s good. Was there anything that you did not like? What types of movies do you typically like? <|endoftext|> I cant really think of anything that didnt exceed my expectations honestly.

Very romantic and funny <|endoftext|> I would love to watch the trailer! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> What type of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> I love movies that focus on a character's growth from how they started to have they end <|endoftext|> Wow, that is cool. What genre would that be? <|endoftext|> drama or biographical- especially about historical figures <|endoftext|> What is the latest movie you've seen? <|endoftext|> I saw IT2 but that's because my kids and their friends needed a ride. i did like how they intertwined the past with present though <|endoftext|> I never heard of that movie. What genre is that? <|endoftext|> horror! it's stephen king -he's a bit too crazy takes the plot off of what could happen to sci fi and weird stuff <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Joker? <|endoftext|> No - is that the one from Bat Man <|endoftext|> Yes, that is related to Batan <|endoftext|> I've heard great things - I forgot about that one - it shows development on how he turned out the way he did, right <|endoftext|> Yes, it goes through his childhood experiences. <|endoftext|> that's really interesting. I bet I would like that <|endoftext|> Rotten tomatoes give it 3 and 1/2 stars <|endoftext|> wow that is pretty good. I think I will go look up their trailer! thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> You'll probably enjoy it. <|endoftext|> I think I will if it's more about him and less about Batman and superheros and things like that. <|endoftext|> Will you accept my recommendation for Joker? <|endoftext|> yes I will definitely accept this recommendation and see the Joker trailer! <|endoftext|> That is great <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> I am looking for a comedy movie, what do you suggest? <|endoftext|> Whats the last movie you watch? <|endoftext|> Frozen II, it was funny, but I am looking more for an adult comedy <|endoftext|> Got it <|endoftext|> Do you have a recommendation? <|endoftext|> Shazam <|endoftext|> What is that about? <|endoftext|> Plot:  We all have a superhero inside us, it just takes a bit of magic to bring it out. In Billy Batson's case, by shouting out one word - SHAZAM - this streetwise fourteen-year-old foster kid can turn into the grown-up superhero Shazam. <|endoftext|> That sounds great! I am definitely going to take you up on your recommedation! <|endoftext|> Ratings: Internet Movie Database: 7.1/10, Rotten Tomatoes: 90%, Metacritic: 70/100 <|endoftext|> I think I will definitely check it out. <|endoftext|> Actors: Zachary Levi, Mark Strong, Asher Angel, Jack Dylan Grazer <|endoftext|> I don't recognize any of the actors, can you tell me anything about them? <|endoftext|> Zachary Levi has been in Thor: Ragnarok  as Fandral <|endoftext|> Oh, I guess I just didn't know his name. Have you see the movie? <|endoftext|> Yes I highly recommend you to watch it <|endoftext|> I definitely will, thank you for your help. <|endoftext|> you are welcome <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Pretty good <|endoftext|> do you want to talk about movies? <|endoftext|> Sure <|endoftext|> what kind of movies do you enjoy watching? <|endoftext|> I like comedies <|endoftext|> any specific comedies you like me to recommend? <|endoftext|> Something with adam sandler <|endoftext|> Happy Gilmore? <|endoftext|> Haven't seen that in ages! <|endoftext|> that movies always makes me laugh, and so does big daddy. <|endoftext|> Little Nicky wasn't without its charm <|endoftext|> thats a great movie? <|endoftext|> It is. <|endoftext|> want me to recommend it for you? <|endoftext|> Sure, why not <|endoftext|> ok I will select Little Nicky. I think thats the movie where he goes to hell and back. <|endoftext|> Yeah, that was the one. Ozzy's in it <|endoftext|> Ok that will be the movie. Thank you so much. <|endoftext|> No problem. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> I'm doing pretty great! See any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes, I've seen some great ones. What about you? <|endoftext|> I've seen a few that I really liked. What kind of movies are you into? I'm a horror and comedy fan myself. <|endoftext|> I love horror and comedy. I also like action, and recently I have really enjoyed documentaries. Which horror movie is your favorite? <|endoftext|> That's a tough one. Honestly I'm a huge fan of earlier horror. I like the new stuff but Nightmare on Elm Street, Wishmaster and Hellraiser.. That era will always be my favorite. See any good ones recently? I've been looking for more modern horror. <|endoftext|> I really like those too. I agree that the new ones aren't bad, but nothing beats the classics. Wow, that makes me think of a couple that you'd probably be interested in because of what you said. Do you like sequels at all? <|endoftext|> Oh heck yeah. I would argue that Nightmare on Elm Street 3 was the best of the whole bunch. And the remake for IT was downright terrifying. <|endoftext|> I know. I also liked the Halloween series. I thought that some of the ones from the 80s were actually better than ones in the 70s. Do you recall who wrote the nightmare on Elm street movies because that'd help me make a recommendation. I think that made a movie recently you'd be interested in <|endoftext|> It was Wes Craven. Love that guys work. Sure they were a little campy but It was the way of things at the time. <|endoftext|> Have you ever heard of Stephen King? Haha, you said you like horror so that might be a silly question. I forgot about his movies but those were some of my favorites growing up. If you like him, I actually have some really good recommendations. <|endoftext|> Bruh. Stephen King is like my favorite author of all time after Orwell. <|endoftext|> Hahaha that's crazy. I love Stephen King, and I love Orwell's QUOTATION_MARK1984QUOTATION_MARK. That's crazy. I also think they did a decent job of turning King's books into movies. Which movies based on his books have you seen? I'll know which one to not recommend based on that. <|endoftext|> 1984 is my exact favorite book actually... As for the King movies IT (Both the 90's one and the remake), Cat's Eye (I think that was him), Pet Cemetery one and two (From back in the day)... Gosh it's been awhile. Gerald's Game. There were a few others but they were all years ago. Fun fact: He used to due the Stan Lee thing where he stuck himself into the movies as a cameo. <|endoftext|> That's crazy. 1984 stuck with me for a long time and influenced me a lot. And that is a good fun fact about King hahaha. Now i'm going to have to look that up. Have you ever watched QUOTATION_MARKThe ShiningQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> *Facepalm* How do I forget The Shining!? I've seen the one with Jack Nickolson in it. Was there a new one? I cause I would watch that in a heartbeat. <|endoftext|> Yes, you have to check out QUOTATION_MARKDoctor SleepQUOTATION_MARK. I watched that in 2019 and it's great. It's QUOTATION_MARKDannyQUOTATION_MARK All grown up. <|endoftext|> WHAT? Yes. I absolutely have to go and watch that. Stephen, you tricky monkey. Couldn't just name it 'Shining 2' could he? I'm definitely going to have to watch that. <|endoftext|> Yeah haha. You'll get why it's called QUOTATION_MARKDoctor SleepQUOTATION_MARK when you see it though. Hey, it was nice talking to you. Have a good day. <|endoftext|> You too! Thanks for the movie recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> How can I help you tonight? Which movie were you interested in? <|endoftext|> I'm interested in romance movies. <|endoftext|> Oh awesome, those are my favorite! Which romantic movie have you seen recently? <|endoftext|> I'm glad we have something in common! The last romantic movie that I watched was QUOTATION_MARKSomeone GreatQUOTATION_MARK on Netflix. It came out about a year ago. <|endoftext|> I will have to watch that one. Would you like a movie similar to that one or more romantic comedy? <|endoftext|> If you have any good suggestions for romantic comedies I'd be more than willing to watch them. <|endoftext|> Got it! <|endoftext|> What was the last romance movie you watched, if you don't mind me asking? <|endoftext|> I love QUOTATION_MARKHow to Lose a Guy in 10 daysQUOTATION_MARK because Matthew McConaughey & Kate Hudson are such a perfect match and I find it to be so relatable. Its my favorite so I keep watching it over and over! <|endoftext|> I'll have to check that one out, I don't think I've ever seen it. <|endoftext|> Oh its definitely worth the watch! Just the right about of comedy but the chemistry is what keeps me watching it :) <|endoftext|> Having the right amount of comedy and chemistry is what makes a great romantic comedy! I'll trust you with this one.! I'll watch it soon! <|endoftext|> Well awesome :) Sounds good! I hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> Were you interested in looking into any other movies? <|endoftext|> Always. I'm a huge fan of action packed movies..I just recently went and saw Bad Boys for Life starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. And I really enjoy horror movies, but I haven't seen on in a while.. <|endoftext|> I saw Bad Boys for Life too! It was the funniest one of the 3! I laughed so hard. It isn't really a horror movie but did you see <|endoftext|> Nice! That was a well anticipated movie I must say, and it definitely was the best out of the three. And I think your message got cut. The last thing you said was QUOTATION_MARKIt really isn't a horror movie but did you see...?QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Yes sorry, I was typing QUOTATION_MARKRambo: Last BloodQUOTATION_MARK but hit enter too soon! It isn't really a horror film but the gore factor takes that action/thriller movie to the next level. It was intense! <|endoftext|> It's all good :) Actually I haven't seen any of the Rambo movies <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you today? <|endoftext|> Great, you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing very well. What kind of movies do you like to watch? <|endoftext|> I like horror, thrillers, and foreign movies. Seen any good ones? <|endoftext|> I got a perfect one that hits all three. Have you seen Parasite? <|endoftext|> No I haven't yet but I will if you recommend it! <|endoftext|> It's amazing. It just won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Foreign Film. It's about a Korean family that tricks a rich family into hiring them and then tries to take over their house. <|endoftext|> Sounds good, I will see it once it comes out on DVD! Thanks for the recommendation <|endoftext|> Have you seen any foreign films that you really like? What do you like about them? <|endoftext|> I like how the plot lines are different than Hollywood. My favorite is Hero, what about you? <|endoftext|> Hero is a gorgeous film! Stellar directing. In that same vein, I think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is my favorite QUOTATION_MARKmartial artsQUOTATION_MARK movie. <|endoftext|> I love martial arts films! I would love to see Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, I accept your recommendation <|endoftext|> Oh good! I'll send along the movie trailer in a minute. What do you like about martial arts films? <|endoftext|> Thank you, I would love to watch a trailer for it! I like how martial arts movies have fighting scenes as well as good plots <|endoftext|> Well I think Crouching Tiger is a perfect film for you. It won four Oscars, including Best Foreign Language Film, and its screenplay was also nominated. What's your favorite martial arts film fight scene? <|endoftext|> Wow I didn't know it won that many oscars. My favorite fight scene is probably the village fight scene at the beginning of Journey to the West. How bout you? <|endoftext|> There's a 2019 film called Shadow that has a fantastic scene where people fight with bladed umbrellas. It's a beautifully choreographed, white-knuckle scene. <|endoftext|> I have never heard of it, what's it about? <|endoftext|> It's hard to completely summarize, but I think Google does a good job: QUOTATION_MARKTo finally achieve victory over a rival kingdom, a brilliant general devises an intricate plan involving his wife, a look-alike and two kings.QUOTATION_MARK I don't have access to the trailer, but I can send you the Crouching Tiger one if you'd like. <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation, please send the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon if you have it! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> hi! <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like to watch with friends? <|endoftext|> mostly comedies. i like to laugh <|endoftext|> Oh great!

Robert Di nero kills his role in it. Yes i would reccomend it <|endoftext|> that sounds great! im definitely going to watch it now! <|endoftext|> It is quite long but enjoyable. Definitley want to grab some snacks and drinks before. Best part is you can watch from Netflix at home! <|endoftext|> that sounds like my kind of night. really excited <|endoftext|> Ill check out good boys aswell. looks like Superbad and those types of commedies.

I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. Do you have any preferences or know what you would like to see? <|endoftext|> i knw i would like something funny <|endoftext|> would you like to see a movie in theatre? or perhaps at home on Netflix? <|endoftext|> i want to see something new so theater i think. but nothing to hard to follow <|endoftext|> What are some of you favorite funny movies, to get a better idea of what you enjoy! <|endoftext|> bridesmaids, Tammy, hustlers, angry birds, jumangi <|endoftext|> Do you have some favorite actors, people who's work tends to make you laugh or you find enjoyable? <|endoftext|> i love melissa mccarthy, and dwayne Johmson <|endoftext|> I don't know if you have seen Melissa Mccarthy's QUOTATION_MARKThe KitchenQUOTATION_MARK it came out last year in august, not still in theatres but <|endoftext|> i have seen it but it isn't a comedy <|endoftext|> Have you heard of Dave Bautista? Most notably he plays the role of Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy. He has a new movie out called QUOTATION_MARKMy SpyQUOTATION_MARK with excellent reviews <|endoftext|> I heard of him. Sounds interesting <|endoftext|> It is a <|endoftext|> is it a comedy? <|endoftext|> Sorry I am having slight technical difficulties. It is a comedy yes! But it is also has adventure, and romance. The reviews are amazing! <|endoftext|> I think I would like to see this <|endoftext|> I think you would enjoy it! He also has a movie called Stuber which I think you would enjoy as well <|endoftext|> great thank you for the recomendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> How's it going? I'm looking for a movie recommendation <|endoftext|> You're talking to the right guy! What kind of movies are you into? Star War is coming out this month and that's going to be huge if you're into Sci Fi. <|endoftext|> I'd love to see the new Star Wars but I have to catch up on the old ones first! <|endoftext|> That's a must. What was the last movie you've recently? <|endoftext|> It was actually return of the jedi last night. I love action films and all the Terminator movies <|endoftext|> I love those as well. Have you heard about Bad Boys 3 coming out this Jan with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. It's got plenty of action and long overdue for part 3. <|endoftext|> No I've never heard of that, what's the story line? <|endoftext|> Well you'll definitely have to catch up on the other 2. It's about two cops in Miami who are best friends. Ones a more tied down family man and the other is a big time playboy who like to live the lavish life. Although they both live completely different lifestyles, they work really well together. It's a very grounded buddy cop movie with plenty of action and comedy. A hit sequel came out and now after many years a third is going to be released in January. <|endoftext|> Well I better watch the first two before that one comes out! <|endoftext|> Since you enjoy action films have you heard and seen the fast and furious franchise? <|endoftext|> Yeah I have seen those. I kind of like corny 80's action movies more <|endoftext|> Say no more. Are you more of a Stallone? Van Damme? or Scharzenegger fan? <|endoftext|> Definitely Schwarzenegger <|endoftext|> So I got two awesome choices you can tell me, which you prefer to hear more about. His awesome 80s hit Predator or Last Action Hero? Although the second one came in the very early 90's I still have to add that because it's very underrated. <|endoftext|> I've seen both of those! This is hard! <|endoftext|> The great thing about 80s films is you can go back and rewatch them so many times and still enjoy it. I forgot to mention his other hit Total Recall! Its such a great 80s film demonstrating his cheesy yet entertaining acting. Set in the future as a regular working guy, he decides to enter a virtual world type place where he lives a fantasy life of a secret agent. Things go haywire in the process that lead to a crazy action adventure on Mars. <|endoftext|> Oh I haven't seen that one! I'll definitely give that one a look. <|endoftext|> You won't regret it! Such a classic and still watchable to this day. <|endoftext|> Thanks for your recommendation! <|endoftext|> No problem. Enjoy the film! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> Hi, What type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> comedy movies for you <|endoftext|> yeah, i love comedy movies <|endoftext|> how old are you <|endoftext|> i am 23.

The original film version was lost but the movie has been redone several times and as recent as 2013 staring Leonardo Dicaprio. I would defiantly check it out. <|endoftext|> It sounds really interesting to me, especially the lastest version <|endoftext|> Yes, A writer and wall street trader finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor, Jay Gatsby. It of course gives us a look at how exciting night life was in the roaring 20s. <|endoftext|> Yes, it's a movie I've always planned on watching, but never got around to it. <|endoftext|> Awesome!! Hope you enjoy as much as I did. <|endoftext|> Is there a trailer for this movie that I could watch? <|endoftext|> There is. <|endoftext|> Thank you!

My favorite one is Into the Spiderverse <|endoftext|> I really loved The Lego Batman movie! I'd have to say it's my QUOTATION_MARKgo-toQUOTATION_MARK for movies I've already watched over 100 times. <|endoftext|> Hm. I've never seen it. I never was into lego movies <|endoftext|> You know what, me either! But the movie captures Batman's humor perfectly. - He's forced to drop is QUOTATION_MARKlone vigilanteQUOTATION_MARK persona and join force with other superheros to beat the Joker from taking over Gotham. <|endoftext|> Yeah,  that kind of sounds interesting. Is that your favorite movie? <|endoftext|> It is! I've always loved Batman for his predetermined nature to be the QUOTATION_MARKoutsiderQUOTATION_MARK of all the superheros. Since I remembered some of your preferences for movies are animation and comic based, I thought this would be something unique for you. Plus there's a lot of funny adult-oriented humor. Although, there's not so much horror since they just break into a bunch of little Lego pieces when they get obliterated. <|endoftext|> Haha that's a pretty great description <|endoftext|> Thank you! Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure! could you send me a link? <|endoftext|> You got it! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> I really hope you enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi.

What type of genre of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like comedies and dramas the best. <|endoftext|> Who are your favorite actors? <|endoftext|> I like movies with Jennifer Aniston or Brad Pitt or Johnie Depp. <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of Tom Cruise by any chance? <|endoftext|> Yes, I like him <|endoftext|> I know he was in the movie Mission Impossible: Fallout. <|endoftext|> Oh yes, I heard about that one, does that one have good reviews? <|endoftext|> It has excellent revies and I highly recommend this movie for you. <|endoftext|> Does it have a lot of action all the way through the movie. I like those kind. <|endoftext|> Yes it does. He is a very talented actor and the movie is fantastic and I think you will love it. <|endoftext|> Ok great! I'm going to watch this movie, thanks so much for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> I could't find the trailer for this movie but I have another movie by him and its called Mission Impossible Rogue Nation <|endoftext|> Is that one as good as the other one you mentioned? <|endoftext|> It is and even better I think because it has won 6 awards and has been nominated 23 times. <|endoftext|> Can you tell me what other actors are in the movie? <|endoftext|> Jeremy Renner, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson. <|endoftext|> I never heard of any of those actors. Are they in a lot of other movies? <|endoftext|> Of Course and especillay Jeremy Renner. <|endoftext|> Oh ok, well I think you have me sold on it. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> You're very welcome and I hope you have a nice day!!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> hi! <|endoftext|> I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> i want to see a combination of action and romance movie <|endoftext|> Hmm, I think I have an interesting on for you to check out with Justin Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried. But before i suggest that have you watched any action/romance movies recently? <|endoftext|> no i haven't. i like justin timberlake and amanda seyfried it looks interesting. i would like to watch it <|endoftext|> Sounds good. Would you mind i leave a few similar suggestions with you before you go off to enjoy your movies? <|endoftext|> sure. more suggestions would give me more options <|endoftext|> There is a movie about artificial intelligence with a similar scifi romance theme cakked Trancendance with Johnny Depp <|endoftext|> i don't like scifi <|endoftext|> No problem. Any other movie prefrences i should know about while i am recommending trailers? <|endoftext|> i would like to see movies similar to Black Panther <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy superhero movies? I can suggest a few that fit your preference <|endoftext|> yes i like superhero movies <|endoftext|> Suicide squad from 2016 is pretty good and involves a romantic plotline, If you haven't seen The Amazing Spiderman i also suggest that. I most recentyly watched Spiderman: Into the Spider verse <|endoftext|> suicide squad sounds interesting because it has action and romance <|endoftext|> I think suicide squad would be a good bet in terms of superheroes. Other than that Avengers: infinity wars has many characters but ultimatley has a good romantic plot as well. i suggest both for sure. I'll recommend suicide squad trailer though. <|endoftext|> thank you. I have heard the Avengers movie is good but it is very long. How long is the movie? <|endoftext|> Suicide squad is about 2 hours and 17 minutes <|endoftext|> i will definitely watch the suicide squad. thank you for your recommendation. have a good day <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi how are you <|endoftext|> good how are you <|endoftext|> i am good. <|endoftext|> i'm thinking of watching a movie tonight <|endoftext|> oh nice. i got some movies to recommend. <|endoftext|> oh perfect. what types are they <|endoftext|> it depends on what kind of movies you like to watch. <|endoftext|> i like dramas and comedies <|endoftext|> newer movies or older type movies? <|endoftext|> i don't mind older movies if they are good <|endoftext|> i have a comedy movie to recommend <|endoftext|> what is it called? <|endoftext|> bad santa <|endoftext|> hmm i have seen that one already <|endoftext|> do you have any movies in mind you like? <|endoftext|> do you have any action films to recommend <|endoftext|> how about Speed with Kennau Reeves <|endoftext|> that sounds cool. i like keanu <|endoftext|> ok I will recommend Speed with Keenau Reeves <|endoftext|> i will watch that. thank you <|endoftext|> your welcome <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help find you a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Excellent. I appreciate the help. I want to find a good movie to take my girlfriend to this weekend. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you two saw together, did she enjoy it? <|endoftext|> The last movie we saw together was Star Wars Rise of Skywalker which she enjoyed but admittedly, we saw it for me. She enjoys comedies more than action. <|endoftext|> Haha, ok.  Are you looking for more of a general comedy film or something perhaps more romantic? <|endoftext|> I'd be willing to go with either or one that's both. I'm just not sure what's out there in those categories. <|endoftext|> Is there an actor or actress in particular that you know she likes? <|endoftext|> She likes Ryan Reynolds. The Deadpool guy. She even says I look a little him. I don't see it. Maybe like his older brother. She loved him and Sandra Bullock in The Proposal. <|endoftext|> Alright, let me see what I can find! <|endoftext|> Thanks for the help. I appreciate it very much. I'm looking forward to spending time together and treating her to a good movie. <|endoftext|> How do you feel about Jumanji: The Next Level? It's a mix of goofy comedy and action with the likes of Kevin Heart, Jack Black, and Dwayne Johnson. <|endoftext|> That has potential. Isn't Dwayne Johnson QUOTATION_MARKThe RockQUOTATION_MARK? <|endoftext|> Yup, I think he dropped the moniker awhile back when he got serious about acting. <|endoftext|> Right. That does look good and I'll make that first on my list. But do have one more recommendation for me as a back-up plan? <|endoftext|> Shockingly there isn't a lot in theaters at the moment, would you be opposed to watching something at home? Otherwise there's Sonic and Bad Boys for Life. <|endoftext|> I'll take a look at both of those. If we do decide to stay home, is there a romantic comedy that you recommend? <|endoftext|> If you don't mind watching something a little older, the original Overboard with Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn. Those two have been an adorable couple in Hollywood for years and the film is a classic romantic comedy as far as I'm concerned. I can tell you a little bit about it if you're interested. <|endoftext|> The classics are always a nice switch. Tell me about it! <|endoftext|> Goldie Hawn plays an uptight high society type who cheats the carpenter (Kurt Russell) who is working on her yacht. After an accident gives her amnesia, he finds her and convinces her they're husband and wife. It sounds a bit dodgy but it's actually pretty adorable, especially when his kids get involved. <|endoftext|> Awww. That actually sounds perfect! Even if we see something in the theater, I'm definitely taking this recommendation. Thank you so much for your help! <|endoftext|> Great, I really hope you two enjoy whatever you decide to see! I'll send the trailer for Overboard straight away, bye and take care. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there! <|endoftext|> hello! <|endoftext|> I'm here to help you find a good movie trailer <|endoftext|> excellent! I like all different kinds of movies, but I think my favorites are comedies and war movies. I don't like rom coms. Any ideas? <|endoftext|> I love war movies too! What are your top 3? <|endoftext|> saving private ryan, black hawk down and I think 1917 that just came out has broken into my top 3 for sure. Loved the flow of that movie with the single shot feeling. If you haven't seen it, it's worth a watch for sure <|endoftext|> It sounds like you like gritty, fast-paced war films. Have you seen Dunkirk or Letters from Iwo Jima? <|endoftext|> is dunkirk the one with harry styles? <|endoftext|> He is in it! I thought he did a great job. By that I mean that he blended right in. You wouldn't have known that he wasn't previously a professional actor. <|endoftext|> Yeah I really liked when he hosted SNL, you could tell he put a lot of effort into his sketches. I feel like I would enjoy watching him do more serious work for a change in dunkirk for sure <|endoftext|> It's one of the most unique war movies I've seen in a long long time. <|endoftext|> Excellent, I look forward to watching it now. thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> yes I would like to watch the trailer <|endoftext|> Have you seen Letters from Iwo Jima? <|endoftext|> I have not. Who stars in that one? <|endoftext|> Ken Watanabe. He's in Inception if you've seen it <|endoftext|> I have seen Inception. Great movie. Would you say the special effects are better in Dunkirk or Letter from Iwo Jima? <|endoftext|> I would say Dunkirk. Letters from Iwo Jima has more of a character focus if that makes sense. <|endoftext|> Got it. I think that Dunkirk sounds more appealing to me honestly. I like a good story, but when I watch a war movie, I want to see a good fight. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you find a movie! How are you? <|endoftext|> Great! And you? <|endoftext|> I am doing well. In order to help you best, what was the most recent movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw was Dark Waters. I am looking for recommendations that will expand my horizons. <|endoftext|> What genres are you interested in getting into? <|endoftext|> I love a good Horror film, or a sappy romance. But am always ready for a good belly laugh Comedy <|endoftext|> From personal experience, I thought QUOTATION_MARKGet OutQUOTATION_MARK was a great horror film, without relying on jump scares. It also won an Academy Award for best original screen play. <|endoftext|> Okay, I will accept that recommendation. Thank you for your help! <|endoftext|> You're welcome. Enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> I will! Thanks again! <|endoftext|> I will say, go into the movie with eyes wide open and and a clear mind. Its a psychological thriller. <|endoftext|> Those tend to be my favorite. Probably why I have a degree in psychology yet love a good horror film. Are there any comedies out I should look into while I am out? <|endoftext|> Do you happen to be fan of Will Ferrell? He is one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> Yes and Adam Sandler. <|endoftext|> If you're a fan of Adam Sandler, I would recommend one of my favorites of his, QUOTATION_MARKThe WaterboyQUOTATION_MARK. <|endoftext|> OK great. Thanks, I will try that movie recommendation as well. <|endoftext|> And for a Will Ferrell movie, you can't go wrong with Anchorman or Step Brothers. Two classics. <|endoftext|> Ok great. <|endoftext|> Alright, let me get you a formal recommendation for QUOTATION_MARKGet OutQUOTATION_MARK. Thank you for letting me help you today. <|endoftext|> Okay that sounds great. I will check your recomendations out. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> I'm going to ask you a few questions about movies that you have watched in order to pick a movie trailer that's best for you. Is that okay? <|endoftext|> Sure thing... <|endoftext|> What was the latest movie that you've seen? <|endoftext|> My partner and I saw Marriage Story last night on Netflix and liked it <|endoftext|> That's an interesting title. Scarlett Johannsen is a great actress! What did you like about the movie? Anything you didn't care for? <|endoftext|> Yup! She was awesome.... it was romantic and serious, not a happy ending but very realistic <|endoftext|> Realistic movies feel easier to relate to. Do you enjoy watching romantic/serious movies or romantic/comedies? <|endoftext|> I have a wide range and enjoy both! What do you recommend? <|endoftext|> I would recommend Blended starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. This movie is both relate-able and fun to watch. It explores how children can feel or behave in a single parent household and also single parents looking for love. Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Blended sounds good. I would love to watch the trailer. Thank you <|endoftext|> Awesome! Please enjoy the trailer! <|endoftext|> Thank you.

Are you interested in a current movie in the box office? <|endoftext|> do you know whats good on amazon prime <|endoftext|> Of course! What type of movies are you interested in?

That way I can narrow it down for you <|endoftext|> I was thinking about a good thriller <|endoftext|> OoOoOO! I love thrillers. Let me think on that. Well, I am doing that. Do you like a specific actor or actress? Maybe I can narrow it down. <|endoftext|> Robert Downy Jr. or Amber Heard <|endoftext|> So, I did think o f a great movie I saw recently. I think it would be perfect. I unfortunatley cant think of anything with Robert Downy Jr or Amber Heard. Thats not a comic book movie. Have you heard of Valerian and the City of a Thousdand Planets. Its preety cool! IF you like the 5th element you might like this. Its about aliens and shapeshifting. It has Cara Delevingne in it. <|endoftext|> that sounds like a great choice <|endoftext|> Yeah. Cara, isn't the greatest actress, but I think she does a great job in this movie. I enjoyed it and I found even though the dialogue was a little bit cheesy.

What do you think the remake got wrong? <|endoftext|> it seemed like the pacing ignored that main guy's progression into doubt <|endoftext|> absolutely. Did you watch Akira?

Do you prefer vintage cyberpunk or are you looking for newer movies/and/or remakes? <|endoftext|> im looking for something newer right now <|endoftext|> thanks! did you see ready player one? <|endoftext|> ya i did <|endoftext|> what did you think of it? <|endoftext|> i think it sucked and i feel like i  wasted my time with it <|endoftext|> for sure.

The premise is about a world with the non-existence of privacy and anonymity. Every person has an implant that records their every move, and their life and records can be accessed anytime through QUOTATION_MARKThe Ether.QUOTATION_MARK I'd be interested to hear your thoughts on it <|endoftext|> i think that sounds interesting and privacy, in the area of data sales, is more topical <|endoftext|> it is definitely an interesting idea.

Do you accept my recommendation? <|endoftext|> ya, thanks a lot <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! how are you? <|endoftext|> Fine dude . How about you ? <|endoftext|> that's good.

Everyone can connect with movies <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I'm here to help. I understand you're looking for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> yes the new star wars but please no spoilers <|endoftext|> I don't like spoilers either. Which Star Wars was the last one you saw? <|endoftext|> ive seen them all except, the newest <|endoftext|> My favorite character in the Star Wars saga is Han Solo. <|endoftext|> yes, Han solo is a wonderful Character in the Saga. Do you have any particular favorite moments of his in the movies <|endoftext|> I saw the first Star Wars when it first opened. His interaction with the characters was priceless. What was yours? <|endoftext|> Of Han, so many I dont know where to begin but i guess my favorites is his relationship with chewy. His quick witty  remarks <|endoftext|> Although Chewy never spoke in a QUOTATION_MARKEnglishQUOTATION_MARK language, his responses were hilarious. <|endoftext|> haha, yes <|endoftext|> So would you like to see the Rise of Skywalker trailer online, TV or a theatre? <|endoftext|> online is the best for me now <|endoftext|> Me too. I can watch all the trailers instead of waiting for new ones to come on TV. Have fun! <|endoftext|> great thanks.. i appreciate the rcommendation and trailer info .. God Bless. <|endoftext|> And you as well. May the Force be with you! <|endoftext|> well we got to do 10 turns of chatting <|endoftext|> An accomplishment for the day. <|endoftext|> any reccomendation for a movie thats out <|endoftext|> Star Wars suggests you like action and sci-fi. Dune is coming out. <|endoftext|> great recommendation.. ill look it up <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. What was the last great movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Hello, I just watched Good Boys. So funny <|endoftext|> Not familiar with that one. Is it a comedy? I know I've heard the title but who was in it escapes me. <|endoftext|> It is a comedy. About kids doing some innapropriate things <|endoftext|> Ah. So kind of like funny teenage movies like QUOTATION_MARKSuper Bad?QUOTATION_MARK Do you like any action films or horror? <|endoftext|> It is like that movie. Same director. I love horror movies as well. the scarier the better. Do you have any recomendations for those? <|endoftext|> I LOVE horror movies. They are my absolute favorite. I can recommend older scary movies. New ones don't seem to be as scary. I like supernatural horror. I think Fantasy island is supposed to be scary. Have you seen that one yet? <|endoftext|> I have not seen that one yet but I want too. I agree that many horror movies today are not scary. i watch some foreign ones these days. They seem to do more scary things. <|endoftext|> They do. I do like the Conjuring films and there is another one coming out this year. Not a spin-off like Annabelle but an actual Conjuring movie. Can't wait. <|endoftext|> I like those as well. i am in the mood for an older scary movie. What would you recommend? <|endoftext|> The Changling with George C. Scott, not Angelina Jolie. What Lies Beneath, Woman in Black was scary too. A British film called Haunted with Aidan Quinn is quite good as well. Hard to find. <|endoftext|> I think I will watch Woman in Black today. I have seen two of the others. I appreciate your advice <|endoftext|> The second one wasn't as scary. I sure hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thank you. Hva e a great day <|endoftext|> You too. Good luck finding scary movies to watch. <|endoftext|> OK. Thank you so much again. I hope I like it <|endoftext|> I'm sure you will. <|endoftext|> Do you know that werewolf in london movie? <|endoftext|> I watched that a ton of years ago. Probably back in the 80's. I think it's a little dated now, the special effects I mean. But that was good scary. <|endoftext|> I was trying to think of an older one for my kids to watch with me but you are righ the special effects are prob awful <|endoftext|> Another older one would be Fright Night. Not the one with Collin Ferrell. Chris Sarandon was in it. About a vampire. <|endoftext|> OHH I forgot about that one. Good catch <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Doing well how about yourself? <|endoftext|> I am great thank you. Would you like to talk about movies? <|endoftext|> I would love to, I'm looking for a good movie to watch. <|endoftext|> What are your top 5 favorite movies? <|endoftext|> Pulp Fiction, The Machinist, Psycho, Jaws, and Memento... kind of an eclectic mix but I really do watch mostly anything. <|endoftext|> Those are all great movies! Psycho is one of my favorites as well. What is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I just watched Jojo Rabbit and absolutely loved it! <|endoftext|> Have you seen any other of Taika Waititi's movies? <|endoftext|> I have seen most of them, he is one of my favorite filmmakers. <|endoftext|> I really liked his movie What We Do in the Shadows, did you see that one? <|endoftext|> I did! I loved the move and the TV show they adapted from it. I love quirky comedies like that. <|endoftext|> I know you have a lot of different tastes in movie genres, are you looking for a quirky comedy, horror, or thriller? <|endoftext|> I love all of those genres, but would prefer quirky comedy. <|endoftext|> Okay. How do you feel about musicals? <|endoftext|> Musicals are not my favorite unless they are a little more offbeat like Moulin Rouge was. <|endoftext|> Have you ever heard of a movie with some singing in it called The Producers? <|endoftext|> I have seen The Producers (both the original and the remake), it was okay but for comedy I would prefer something that is not a musical. <|endoftext|> Okay. Have you seen some other satirical comedies like The Interview, Tropic Thunder or Sorry to Bother You? <|endoftext|> I have not seen Sorry to Bother You, but heard it was good. I do want to see that movie. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer for it? <|endoftext|> I have seen it before and it does look like a good movie. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Dr. Strangelove? <|endoftext|> I have, but it has been a long time. <|endoftext|> What about Monty Python's Life of Bryan? <|endoftext|> I love Monty Python movies and I have seen all of those. If you know of a farce comedy like that I would be into it. <|endoftext|> You are quite the movie enthusiast! Have you seen Robin Hood Men in Tights? <|endoftext|> Haha, yes I've seen a lot. I do love Robin Hood Men in Tights and I think all of Mel Brooks' other movies. Great comedian! <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of horror comedies too like Shaun of the Dead? <|endoftext|> Yes, I love horror comedy. Shaun of the Dead is one of my top 10 movies. <|endoftext|> Have you seen Zombeavers? <|endoftext|> I have not, can you tell me more about it? <|endoftext|> I would love too! It is a horror comedy about a bunch of college friends that go up to a cabin for a getaway that is ruined by a bunch of zombie beavers. It is one of those movies that is aware it isn't great and is able to poke fun at itself. Would you like to watch the trailer for it? <|endoftext|> Yes please. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello there how are you today?? <|endoftext|> Hello. I'm good, how are you/ <|endoftext|> Living the dream one day at a time! <|endoftext|> Excellent. I'm looking for a movie trailer. I really love action movies. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Well currently if you want to go to the movie theater you could see the new star wars film. rise of skywalker. It is really good and will keep you on you seats edge for the whole movie. but if you are looking to stay in and rent or stream a good movie i would go with terminator dark fury or fast and furious hobbs and shaw. both of these movies are very good and will keep you well entertained . <|endoftext|> I'm definitely interested in the Terminator franchise. I'll go with that pick. <|endoftext|> You will not regret it ! it has the return of the original Sarah Conner ( well the lady who played her in the very first movie, Linda Hamilton i believe is her name), as well as Arnold as the terminator that has aged thru time who has stayed to make sure things stay on track for the human race and sky net never rises. plus the new terminators are awesome!!! the graphics and effects are next level for sure <|endoftext|> Is her son in this version of the movie as well? (The co-star of Terminator 2) <|endoftext|> yes he is, i didnt wanna spoil it!! <|endoftext|> How do they address QUOTATION_MARKageingQUOTATION_MARK the terminator? Seems like an odd thing for robots to do. <|endoftext|> well the t1000 is a endo skeletal machine system with living organic tissue. basically he gets older looking but his nucular battery keeps him going. they addressed this in the last movie genesis <|endoftext|> which streaming platforms can I find this on? <|endoftext|> vudu, hulu, redbox, youtube tv, etc <|endoftext|> Do I have to pay for the movie or just the streaming platform? <|endoftext|> both really you can find it thru vudu and redbox for like 3.99 those are pay to play, but hulu is a service where you pay  monthly amount and stream all you want,. <|endoftext|> Did the new terminator movie have a theatrical release? <|endoftext|> last year actually <|endoftext|> Was it successful? <|endoftext|> thats really a debate. some people didnt like it, but i think they where not bog fans of the franchise before hand, but fans of the franchise loved it. <|endoftext|> I wonder if Arnold's off-screen shenanigans played into that at all. <|endoftext|> i dont think so .. well i have to log off now. is there anything else i can answer for you or help you with ? <|endoftext|> That is all. Thank you! <|endoftext|> glad to help!!! have a great day and enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! Do you know what kind of movie you would like to watch? <|endoftext|> Hello,  Yes i would like to watch Sonic <|endoftext|> What do you like about Sonic? <|endoftext|> I like all Jim Carey Movies <|endoftext|> I remember you saying you like Sonic because it has Jim Carey in it. Sonic is a family friendly movie- would you like a recommendation for more family friendly Jim Carey movies? <|endoftext|> well maybe ace ventura  its a good family friendly movie <|endoftext|> What other movies do you like? I think action movies are very exiting. Do you like them too? <|endoftext|> BAD BOYS 2 <|endoftext|> What do you like about Bad Boys 2? <|endoftext|> The characters and how intense the movie is <|endoftext|> I like it when movies are intense and I can connect with the characters too. Since you liked Bad Boys 2, I would recommend watching watching Bad Boys for Life. It's the third movie in the Bad Boys trilogy, with all the same characters and intensity you love. <|endoftext|> yes thanks for the recommendation. <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> yes definetely <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I think you will really enjoy this movie, especially since you liked the other Bad Boys movies. This newest installation in the Bad Boys trilogy shows Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowery reuniting when an Albanian Mercenary promises them an important bonus. Who is your favorite character in this film? <|endoftext|> Marcus Burnett played by Martin Lawrence, He is very funny <|endoftext|> I agree, Marcus Burnett is very funny. I also really like Mike Lowery. <|endoftext|> yea will smith is very funny as well <|endoftext|> Will Smith is my favorite actor in the film. I'm glad you've decided to watch the trailer for Bad Boys for Life. I think you'll really enjoy it! <|endoftext|> yes I will thanks again <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey! My name is Morgan, How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Hello! my name is Sara, I am doing very well, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm ready to get off work lol, It has definitely been a Monday lol.... <|endoftext|> I feel that lol i've been at uni all day! <|endoftext|> boo lol Have you seen the new Frozen 2 movie? My daughter is currently watching that movie on repeat lol <|endoftext|> I actually have not seen it yet but heard that it's very good. I would like to watch it sometime because I really liked the first one <|endoftext|> Okay, what about Frozen did you like> / <|endoftext|> I liked the plot of it and I really liked some of the characters. Some of the soundtrack was pretty decent too <|endoftext|> Okay, so you like musicals? and something family related <|endoftext|> Yes I do like musicals and family related. I also enjoy romance and horror movies as well <|endoftext|> Oh I bet you would like Sleepy Hallow!!! <|endoftext|> I've actually never seen it but I have heard that it is really good! <|endoftext|> Okay great!!! I'll send you the trailer <|endoftext|> Sounds good, thank you! <|endoftext|> Great I am so happy I was able to recommend something :-) <|endoftext|> Me too!

I will send that trailer in a few minutes, sorry my internet is acting up <|endoftext|> That's ok, I totally understand! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good amazing, how about you? <|endoftext|> Good. I'm looking for some good movie recommendations. Do you have any? <|endoftext|> Absolutely. Can you give me some examples of movies you watched and enjoyed? <|endoftext|> Well the most recent movie I watched was Ex Machina. It was a sci-fi movie with a lot of deeper meanings. I have always liked movies that have to do with the future, especially ones that deal in psychology and human behavior. <|endoftext|> Great movie! Are you more interested in newer movies, or no preference? <|endoftext|> No preference, I like any movie with good writing. I also like movies that have many twists and turns. <|endoftext|> Do you like movies with a lot of action in them, or one that are more focused on the story and build up of events? <|endoftext|> I like ones that are more focused on the story and events. I like very complex storylines. <|endoftext|> I think I have the perfect movie for you. Do you enjoy a movie that you want to re-watch after its over because the ending was so unexpected? <|endoftext|> That sounds like the perfect movie, what is it? <|endoftext|> I recommend the 2013 movie Coherence directed by James Ward Byrkit. <|endoftext|> I have not heard of this one before. What is it about? <|endoftext|> Its about a group of friends having a dinner party on the night of a comet passing over Earth. The comet starts to cause a lot of strange things to start happening. After watching it you will want to watch it again to pick up on all the things you learned at the end of the first watch! <|endoftext|> Sounds like my kind of movie. Is it available to watch for free anywhere? <|endoftext|> I believe it is on Hulu but I am not positive. <|endoftext|> Ok thank you so much for the recommendation. I have hulu, so I will go and watch it now. <|endoftext|> Perfect I hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|> Are there any well known actors in it? <|endoftext|> Surprisingly not. the main actors in this movie are: Emily Baldoni, Maury Sterling, Nicholas Brendon, Lorene Scafaria. <|endoftext|> I have not heard of them, but I think it will still be fun to watch. Thanks again for the recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Hi, I am good. How are you? <|endoftext|> Pretty well. I was just thinking about watching a movie to relax. Do you like movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I do! In fact I am looking for a movie trailer to watch. <|endoftext|> Awesome. What kind of movies are your favorites? <|endoftext|> I like the movie World War Z a lot. I like all kinds of sci-fi and post-apocalyptic types of movies. <|endoftext|> Got it. <|endoftext|> Do you know of any good movies of that genre? <|endoftext|> I have a couple suggestions. Have you seen Zombieland or I Am Legend? <|endoftext|> Yes, I have seen both! <|endoftext|> SInce you like Zombieland, I would suggest Zombieland 2. It has some really funny parts and even some dopplegangers! <|endoftext|> Ok! I accept your suggestion. <|endoftext|> That's great. I really think you'll enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Is it out yet? <|endoftext|> Yes. I've seen it myself and really enjoyed it. <|endoftext|> Do they use the same actors and actresses? Or is that what you meant by doppelgangers? <|endoftext|> They use the same actors and actresses, but there's a funny part where they meet some people similar to them. <|endoftext|> Oh that is great. Do you know if it is still in theaters? <|endoftext|> I do not believe that it is in most theaters. I believe you can watch it at Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Redbox. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, I had no idea. <|endoftext|> Is there anything else I can help you with? <|endoftext|> No, thats all. Thank you! <|endoftext|> Have a great rest of your night, and I hope you enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hii Shall I review about Baby Driver <|endoftext|> Yeah it was an amazing thrill movie <|endoftext|> Well, do you expect Avatar 2? <|endoftext|> Hmm, Yes waiting that movie ready to watch with 3D print <|endoftext|> Ohh Ok sir <|endoftext|> How much spend time to watch a new movie <|endoftext|> Just 2 hours <|endoftext|> Really!

I tend to like horror movies, know of any? <|endoftext|> Have you heard of QUOTATION_MARKthe boy 2QUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Yes, i've seen the first one! I've seen one trailer for it already on tv but not any other. <|endoftext|> Oh what did you like about it? I think you will like this one if you liked the last. <|endoftext|> I liked how the story unfolded and finding out what was happening. I enjoyed the suspense. Is this from the same director? <|endoftext|> yes William Brent Bell was the director from the first as well. <|endoftext|> Cool, i'll check some of the other trailers for it. Thank you. <|endoftext|> No problem! <|endoftext|> Do you know of any other good upcoming horror movies? <|endoftext|> how about QUOTATION_MARKscary movieQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Are they remaking it or making a new one? <|endoftext|> I think they're done making them <|endoftext|> Oh, okay. I think i've seen all of them already, can you recommend me a different one? <|endoftext|> how about doctor sleep? <|endoftext|> I don't know anything about it. What's it about? <|endoftext|> its like a sequel years following the events of the shining, now-adult Dan Torrance meets a young girl with powers similar to his and he tries to protect her from a cult that preys on children with powers to remain immortal. <|endoftext|> Oh, cool. I didn't know anything about it, that's good to know. I'll certainly check it out now thanks! <|endoftext|> Good glad you like the recommendation. <|endoftext|> Thanks again <|endoftext|> you're welcome, enjoy your movie friend. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there! How are you doing this morning? <|endoftext|> Okay. I'm kinda bored, though... Part of me wants to go watch a movie. Got any recommendations? <|endoftext|> For sure! What types of movies do you typically enjoy watching? What was the last film you saw? <|endoftext|> My tastes are pretty varied, but I tend to prefer stuff with a decent amount of action or a good sense of humor. Not outright comedies, just funny movies. For example, the last movie I saw in theaters, if I'm remembering correctly, was Knives Out a couple months back. That was pretty funny. <|endoftext|> I absolutely loved Knives Out. I was hoping I'd be able to recommend it, truth be told. There was certainly plenty of action in the latest Star Wars film, if you're into that. I gravitate towards a lot of horror and thriller films, myself. <|endoftext|> Knives Out was great, but its advertising campaign painted a pretty bland picture of the movie... All its trailers sold it short by a longshot. And Star Wars films always have action, but I was a bit burnt out on the current trilogy after watching The Last Jedi, and the rumors about the thing with Palpatine turned me away from it immediately. Didn't stop me from loving Solo, though - there's nothing better than an entertaining heist movie. Anyway... I don't like horror. I'm a squeamish wuss, and also from my perspective those movies' trailers all kinda just blend together... <|endoftext|> I think that's a fair observation of the genre, unfortunately. While the humor may not be as present, Rian Johnson's premier film called Looper was excellent as well, I thought. Films like Brick and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels also come to mind. <|endoftext|> I have heard really good things about Looper, but I don't think I've ever actually seen it... What're the other two like? <|endoftext|> Brick is a pretty sleek noir film, not too funny but great as a hardboiled detective story. Lock, Stock is a more lighthearted crime comedy about a group of friends who find themselves having to rob a small gang. Very funny, witty banter throughout. And if you like whodunnits, Murder on the Orient Express was delightful, at The Hateful Eight stands as a masterpiece. <|endoftext|> Pardon the rhyme, but The Hateful Eight was great. Movies with Tarantino involved usually aren't really everyone's cup of tea, but I found the interactions between the characters and the mysteries surrounding them to be really intriguing. <|endoftext|> I believe it may just be my favorite Tarantino film, which is not something I can say lightly. <|endoftext|> I'm not sure which I'd rank as my favorite, but The Hateful Eight is definitely up there. That and the Kill Bill duology, which are probably two of the nerdiest action movies I've ever seen. Can't help but love 'em. Speaking of Tarantino, do you know if Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood (gog that title's a pain to type out) was any good? <|endoftext|> It was fantastic. In fact, if you haven't seen it and are a fan of Tarantino, I'd list it as my top recommendation. I can't think of any better films this past year save perhaps Parasite as I haven't seen it. I was going to search for the trailer but it can't seem to be found. <|endoftext|> Were you looking for a specific trailer, or just any trailer for the movie? Cause if it's the latter, I could just search it on YouTube. <|endoftext|> Just any trailer that the engine would find. It did manage to pull up one for Brick, though. <|endoftext|> Throw it at me. And, yeah, I'll accept the recommendation for Once Upon A Time I'm Not Typing Out The Full Title Again. Was already pretty interested in that movie, and hearing that it is indeed pretty good makes me wanna watch it more. <|endoftext|> I'm so glad to hear that! I've actually enjoyed this quite a bit. I don't get to talk about movies nearly as often as I would like. <|endoftext|> That... also looks really interesting, dang. Definitely accepting that recommendation too. Thanks for the talk, man. Glad to have given you the opportunity to share some nice-lookin' films! <|endoftext|> You're very welcome. Glad to meet you! Hopefully you enjoy Once Upon a Time as much as I did! <|endoftext|> Here's hoping I run into you again, man. You were interesting to talk with. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, can I help you pick a movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I'd like a recommendation please <|endoftext|> awesome. Can you tell me what types of movies you like? <|endoftext|> Im a big fan of sci-fi,action,adventure, and thrillers <|endoftext|> i love action/adventure and thrillers too! do you have any favorite actors or actresses? <|endoftext|> The actor/actress is not really important to me as long as the plot is good and there is plenty of action. Visual effects are a big plus. <|endoftext|> ok cool - 1 more question...would you prefer a new release or something that's been out for a while? <|endoftext|> Definitely something new and fresh <|endoftext|> ok, here's my favorite favorite movie that I've seen recently - Bad Boys 3 <|endoftext|> That sounds good to me. I accept your recommendation. Seems like a great action flick. <|endoftext|> it is great, not only a lot of action but really funny too! <|endoftext|> Is it as funny as the previous Bad Boys films? Or funnier? Martin Lawrence cracks me up everytime. <|endoftext|> In my opinion, it's the second funniest after the original movie. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Can you recommend something else? Im a big fan of comic-book movies. <|endoftext|> I'm not as big a fan of comic book movies, but i've heard bloodshot is supposed to be really good. <|endoftext|> Is that the one with Vin Diesel? <|endoftext|> yup, that's the one <|endoftext|> Ok I'll take your word for it. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> ok cool...do you think you'd prefer bad boys or bloodshot? <|endoftext|> Probably Bad Boys because Im familiar with the previous films so I know what to expect. Bloodshot might just be a nice surprise though. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. <|endoftext|> Hi there <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> Adventure, romance, nothing with a diff language I have a hard time understanding <|endoftext|> I would recommend any of the Marvel superhero movies for adventure. <|endoftext|> I like Marvel, actually just watched the Joker last night <|endoftext|> Joaquin Phoenix is great in that. <|endoftext|> Yes, alot of mixed reviews from other people. But I really enjoyed it. <|endoftext|> Would you want to watch a trailer for Captain Marvel? <|endoftext|> Sure, I can watch a trailer <|endoftext|> This movie came out last year and is one of the more recent Marvel movies. <|endoftext|> Okay, I personally have no watched it yet, but I believe my son has. <|endoftext|> It's got a good cast and female lead. <|endoftext|> Brie Larson is a good actress and she keeps you watching. Really easy to get into her story role. <|endoftext|> Also Samuel L. Jackson is one of my favorite actors. <|endoftext|> I could listen to Samuel L Jackson talk all day. I love everything he stars in. <|endoftext|> The storyline looks really interesting too. <|endoftext|> The graphics in the movie look amazing. They chose great actors for this movie for sure. <|endoftext|> Agreed on the graphics. They really push the boundaries of what Hollywood is capable of. <|endoftext|> We love Marvel here in this house, it seems like they keep you on your toes through the whole movie. It would be great to watch in 3D. <|endoftext|> Yes these are great movies to watch in 3D. <|endoftext|> Alot of people called it a flop, but I am willing to disagree on that opinion. <|endoftext|> Me too. I hope you enjoy the trailer and the movie! <|endoftext|> Thank you for the recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hello! I'm looking for a recommendation on a movie <|endoftext|> What kind of movie are you looking for? <|endoftext|> I really enjoy comedies and intriguing stories. I'm not a fan of horror or sci-fi <|endoftext|> I would recommend the movie What We Do In the Shadows! It's a mockumentary about a group of vampires \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd it's pretty funny and has an interesting story <|endoftext|> that sounds interesting but I don't care for Vampire type movies, I consider those to be sci-fi. I really like a good plot, modern and relevant to what's happening in real life. <|endoftext|> Hm, the movie The Meyerowitz Stories is pretty good, it's a comedy-drama about a somewhat estranged family being brought together because of their father's art show <|endoftext|> That does sound interesting! I'm going to accept that recommendation, I'm really excited to watch it! <|endoftext|> Great \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd I hope you like it! <|endoftext|> Do you have any other recommendations like that movie? <|endoftext|> That movie stars Adam Sandler in a somewhat dramatic role, so I'd recommend another one of his more serious movies as well, like Uncut Gems or Punch-Drunk Love <|endoftext|> I have never heard of those, I'll be sure to add those to my list. Thank you very much and I accept these recommendations! All of them! <|endoftext|> Great! I think most of them are on Netflix as well! <|endoftext|> Awesome, I'm a big netflix fan <|endoftext|> 50 First Dates is another I'd recommend <|endoftext|> Do you have anything besides Adam Sandler movies? <|endoftext|> Yeah, if you like comedies, I'd also recommend The Disaster Artist, it's a comedy based on the making of the movie The Room, which is widely regarded as one of the worst movies of all time. It's pretty funny! <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting. Who are some of the actors in that movie? <|endoftext|> James Franco, Dave Franco, and Seth Rogen <|endoftext|> Is that movie on Netflix? <|endoftext|> I think it's on European Netflix, but I'm not sure about US Netflix <|endoftext|> Well that won't work for me. <|endoftext|> Another I would recommend is Superbad, which I believe is on Netlifx <|endoftext|> Okay - thank you very much. I will look for all of these movies! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, can I help you find a movie? <|endoftext|> Hey, yes I would like a recommendation on an adventure movie <|endoftext|> What was the last adventure movie you enjoyed? <|endoftext|> I really enjoyed Jumanji <|endoftext|> Ha! That\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds what i was going to suggest <|endoftext|> Yeah I really enjoyed the plot. But I'm interested in any kind of adventure movie. <|endoftext|> Have you heard of \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdThe Aeronauts\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd? <|endoftext|> I haven't. Can you tell me about it? <|endoftext|> In 1862 headstrong scientist James Glaisher and wealthy young widow Amelia Wren mount a balloon expedition to fly higher than anyone in history. As their perilous ascent reduces their chances of survival, the unlikely duo soon discover things about themselves -- and each other -- that help both of them find their place in the world. <|endoftext|> Sounds exciting. Do you know which actors are in the movie? <|endoftext|> Felicity Jones <|endoftext|> What year did this movie come out? <|endoftext|> Oct of 2019 - Eddie Redmayne is in it as well <|endoftext|> I like that actor and other movies he's been in. <|endoftext|> It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds also inspired by a true story if you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdre into biography <|endoftext|> I am very interested in historical events. <|endoftext|> I think this sounds like a great movie to give a shot then <|endoftext|> I agree. I think I would enjoy this film! <|endoftext|> Sounds great! <|endoftext|> Thank you for the recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hey? <|endoftext|> Hello,  Any movie recommendations for me? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Golden Arc? <|endoftext|> No, what is that about? <|endoftext|> Well before i get to that i should say it's an anime are you still interested to know more? <|endoftext|> No, not into anime.

The next one is their continued 'quietness'. <|endoftext|> cool ill look into it thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> hi there <|endoftext|> watch any good movies latley? <|endoftext|> hmmm, I did watch Bird's of Prey, that movie with Harley Quinn, and Parasite not too long ago! <|endoftext|> oh nice i heard parasite was the first south korean film to win an oscar <|endoftext|> yes it was! it was quite an interesting movie <|endoftext|> It really was, I watched Joker recently with joaquin phoenix and it was great, have you seen this one? <|endoftext|> I haven't actually! Is it good? <|endoftext|> It is awesome and joaquin phoenix role is fantastic, I would highly recommend watching it. <|endoftext|> Sounds like a plan, I'll accept your recommendation. I've actually been meaning to watch it for a while. I hear it talks about why the Joker got all messed up which interests me from a psychological point of view. <|endoftext|> yea its great, are there any movies you haven't watched that you want to? <|endoftext|> hmmm, is the sonic movie any good? <|endoftext|> I unfortunately haven't seen it but after all the work they did to fix it I think it looks really good. <|endoftext|> yeah, didn't it get good ratings too? <|endoftext|> yea it got decent reviews around 6 and 7 out of 10 <|endoftext|> sounds about right for a live action movie from a video game haha <|endoftext|> yea lol I want to see that and once upon a time in hollywood. <|endoftext|> whats once upon a time in hollywood? <|endoftext|> its quentin tarantino's newest movie, I have seen all of his other films but haven't got to see this one quite yet. <|endoftext|> ooo i like his movies! i think ill watch it <|endoftext|> sounds good you definitely should.:) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello!(: <|endoftext|> Howdy!! <|endoftext|> how're ya doing? <|endoftext|> Good, thanks for asking <|endoftext|> thats good! im curious what was the last movie you saw?:) <|endoftext|> I can't remember the last movie i saw in theaters but last week i binged all the sam raimi Spider-Man movies <|endoftext|> thats dope! spider-man has to be my favorite hero from the MCU, so, movie wise, what did you like about it and do you want a story similar to that or different? <|endoftext|> well i grew up on the raimi spider-man movies so they just hold a special spot in my heart, but the past few months ive been getting into some psychological kind of stuff. id say im looking for something along the lines of like Shutter Island, Donny Darko, Silence of the Lambs, doesnt have to be about murders... just something to make you think <|endoftext|> Mmm, i see. Have you seen memento? <|endoftext|> No i haven't but i've heard a lot about it... i looove Chris Nolan movies, that sounds like a perfect suggestion. i accept! <|endoftext|> Awesome! <|endoftext|> Alright i guess i click done now? <|endoftext|> I believe so :) <|endoftext|> actually, before i go... what kind of movies are you into? <|endoftext|> mm to be honest im into psychological stuff too, but mostly movies based off of books, (or true stories in general) haha <|endoftext|> ahh, have you seen Empire of the Sun? <|endoftext|> No i havent, do you recommend it? also, i really enjoy tim burton's stuff! <|endoftext|> I do and i don't at the same time, its Spielburg and like an 8 year old christian bale. i really liked it but its kinda tough to watch at some parts and gets a little cracked out and confusing towards the end. its about a little British boy getting taken from his parents and put in an internment camp soooooo, can be edgy <|endoftext|> mm sounds like something middle school me would've been very into, haha. sounds interesting though, maybe ill have to check it out sometime. <|endoftext|> well, im gonna go watch myself some 'Momento', it was nice chatting with ya! have a good one <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi! do you like movies? <|endoftext|> Yes, I love movies!

What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> Baywatch with Dwayne Johnson. <|endoftext|> That's a great movie! The cast in it is great! Did you enjoy it? <|endoftext|> I did, and I am actually currently listening to it in the background. Today has pretty much been a movie day for me. <|endoftext|> That sounds wonderful. I wish movie days were every day. I personally like to watch movies every Tuesday with my roommates. <|endoftext|> Nice, my girlfriend has been sick so we have watched several marvel movies and have now transitioned to non super hero movies. Haha <|endoftext|> How fun, do you guys like the Avengers? What about Captain America Civil War? Definitely one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> I do, my girlfriend is just now getting into them. I actually havent watched Captain America Civil War since it came out in theaters. I agree, it is a really good movie <|endoftext|> Would you want to watch the trailer for Civil War? Definitely one to watch. I know you are transitioning into non-hero movies so I have another recommendation if you don;t want a hero movie. <|endoftext|> whats your other recommendation? <|endoftext|> Central Intelligence! Dwayne Johnson is in it and it's filled with action but also very funny thanks to Kevin Hart. <|endoftext|> That actually sounds like a good one. Im not sure if I have seen that one yet. <|endoftext|> Oh it's hilarious and one that'll keep you on your toes. Do you like Kevin Hart? <|endoftext|> yes, i love his movies. <|endoftext|> Good, you might enjoy this one, then. Do you care for ratings in movies? Or do you typically go with your gut? <|endoftext|> Go with my gut. i have seen several poor ratings, but have loved the movie. <|endoftext|> I am on the same boat! Everybody has different tastes and sometimes these Hollywood critics are mega harsh! <|endoftext|> that is true. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi, I have some time at home because of the Corona outbreak. I'd really like something to take my mind off of it. <|endoftext|> What type of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> It depends. I like romance, sometimes SCI-Fi. But I don't think I want to watch anything scary. I'm looking for something that I can really escape into. <|endoftext|> Have you watched Interstellar? <|endoftext|> Oh, that's a good one. I keep meaning to rewatch it because I always feel like I'm missing a little something. <|endoftext|> If you like that one Ad Astra is another good space movie. <|endoftext|> Is that the one with Brad Pitt? <|endoftext|> Yes it came out in 2019, its another interesting story. <|endoftext|> I didn't catch that one. I'll totally watch that tonight. <|endoftext|> Yes its a great one to watch! <|endoftext|> I'll accept. Thanks for your help. <|endoftext|> of course your welcome! <|endoftext|> Hey, before you go. Did you see the movie? <|endoftext|> Yed I watched the movie. Another movie like Interstellar where their mission to space threatens the universe. <|endoftext|> I'm wondering if there's a movie that doesn't have people losing kids or parents. <|endoftext|> Jumanji 2 was a great movie and funny <|endoftext|> I didn't see that in the theater either. I kind of don't like Kevin Hart though. <|endoftext|> Yeah he can be too much thats forsure, its a great movie though without anyone losing their lives. <|endoftext|> That's really helpful right now. I'll watch that one. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help with with a movie recommendation. <|endoftext|> I love seeing a new movies! I often like to go for comedy <|endoftext|> I am a sucker for a good comedy as well! What is the last comedy that you have seen? <|endoftext|> I recently just watch Murder Mystery with Adam Sandler <|endoftext|> Adam Sandler is great! I loved him in Bedtime Stories! <|endoftext|> great movie! Love the plot of how imagination became real life. <|endoftext|> You are so right! I was surprised at how appealing it was to adults and kids alike. <|endoftext|> yes. Do you recommend any comedic movies you have seen recently? <|endoftext|> Actually, Ive heard good things about beach bum! Adam Sandler is not starring but it seems like something even he would enjoy! <|endoftext|> I never heard of it! what is the plot? <|endoftext|> Its about a stoner played by Matthew McConaughey that lives life by his own rules. <|endoftext|> I love Matthew McConaughey! Great recommendation I'll definitely watch! <|endoftext|> Good deal! I'm adding that one to my list as well! <|endoftext|> I also do like a good Horror Movie as well, not so much paranormal. But more suspenseful, Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> I don't have as much experience with horror  but Id love to send you the trailer for Beach Bum, if you're interested? <|endoftext|> Sure I would love to see the trailer <|endoftext|> Great! I'll get that ready for you. <|endoftext|> That would be great thanks! <|endoftext|> While that is gearing up, I did some research on some recommended horror flicks. <|endoftext|> Oh great! I love a thriller, in the day light of course <|endoftext|> I'm with you there! <|endoftext|> What is your reccomendation? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Us? or Midsommar? <|endoftext|> I have seen Us. What a great movie! I have not seen midsommar. What is the plot? <|endoftext|> It is about a couple traveling to Sweden to visit a popular mid-summer festival. There is a twist that makes this more than an idyllic vacation tour. <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting I'll definitely look into it! thanks for your recommendations <|endoftext|> I am glad to help! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Oh hey how are you doing today? Are you looking for a movie recommendation? <|endoftext|> yes how are you <|endoftext|> I'm doing great! :) So what types of movies are you interested in? <|endoftext|> I mostly like romantic comedies, and family comedies, I can watch anything under the sun but I cannot watch horror movies. <|endoftext|> Wow rom-coms they are the best! And I know what you mean about horror movies being too scary <|endoftext|> They are just feel good movies so it places you in a good and happy mood. <|endoftext|> Would you happen to remember the last rom-com you watched and liked? <|endoftext|> Yes I watched fifty shades of freed. <|endoftext|> I see! What did you like about that movie? <|endoftext|> I think its more on the plot and the story line since i have watched the previous movies to its sequel. I also admire the actors and actresses, it looks like a well funded movie, and it is QUOTATION_MARKmainstreamQUOTATION_MARK, you just have to watch it to be in the QUOTATION_MARKincrowdQUOTATION_MARK i guess. <|endoftext|> Oh interesting there's a movie I think you will love then!! It's called A Star Is Born <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation for a movie. I cant wait to watch it. <|endoftext|> Great! It's got an all-star cast with Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper :) <|endoftext|> I know I have searched it on google. Thanks again! <|endoftext|> Please enjoy the film :) <|endoftext|> I will do it seems like its going to be an epic film. Do you have other movies in mind? <|endoftext|> Hmm if you like epic movies I may recommend the recent Disney Star Wars series or Marvel's Black Panther <|endoftext|> I have watch the Black Panther I enjoyed that movie. Ive never been a star wars fan, though I watch the return of the saga. Thanks for the suggestions. <|endoftext|> How about The Lord of the Rings trilogy? I loved watching those movies as a kid :) <|endoftext|> That sounds interesting! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Have you seen any of the best picture nominees this year 2920? <|endoftext|> I'm not sure what the nominees are, to be honest. <|endoftext|> Well, I see you like classics then, like me, is it correct? <|endoftext|> That depends on which classics, but yes, some of the movies can be pretty good. What was the name of the one recently...Mutiny on the Bounty? Was pretty good. <|endoftext|> Well I can recommend you some classics, like Titanic, terminator 1, Matrix, and so on, but I have one that is my all time favorite movie, do you like to know its name? <|endoftext|> Sure, what's your all-itime fave? <|endoftext|> Contact 1997 with Jodie Foster. Under my point of view, it is the most beautiful and meaningful movie ever made, did you watch it ? <|endoftext|> No, I haven't. Wasn't there also a more recent movie with that name, with the aliens? <|endoftext|> I haven't heard about a new one, but that one is something worth to spend couple of hours watching. It has a great great message, it is very interesting, her performance is tremendous and it leaves you a good taste. I recommend you to watch it, and you will evaluate it by yourself <|endoftext|> Sure. One quick question though, what's the genre? <|endoftext|> Drama, even thou it has lots of action and technology <|endoftext|> Awesome. I'll see if I can get the chance to check it out. <|endoftext|> Great! you won't regret it, I can bet <|endoftext|> Alright. Can I get a second reccomendation, actually? Not because the first one is bad by any means, just need an additional one :D <|endoftext|> Well, another picture I enjoyed a lot, which is less profound, but with a great message too is QUOTATION_MARKJunoQUOTATION_MARK, it is very light but with very good story, have you watched it ? <|endoftext|> I've definitely at least heard of it, I think. Was it an animated movie by any chance? <|endoftext|> No, it is about a girl who gets pregnant at 16 and it starts a big drama with a happy ending. Jenifer Garner is one of the main actresses and the movie won an Oscar too <|endoftext|> Ahhh. Yes, I've definitely heard of it, just wasn't thinking of the right thing at the time. Anyway, that will do. Thanks! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm here to recommend a move trailer for you. Do you know what kind of move trailer you might be interested in? <|endoftext|> A suspensfull movie <|endoftext|> I recently watched a movie called Knives out, where an eccentric and wealthy author is murdered and his family members are all suspects. Would you be into that? <|endoftext|> Yes that sounds very interesting. Did it have a lot of twists and turns? <|endoftext|> It's the type of movie where you won't see the end coming. Do you like Daniel Craig or Chris Evans? <|endoftext|> Yes. Love those kinds of movies. I am not so familiar with the cast you mention. But I think you have made an excellent recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> So would like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would. I accept. <|endoftext|> Awesome, hope you end up liking it. Take care! <|endoftext|> You must tell me your best part of the movie. <|endoftext|> It's definitely Daniel Craig's performance. <|endoftext|> What other movies has he played in? <|endoftext|> Most people know him from 007. I was shocked to see him doing a southern accent in Knives Out. <|endoftext|> Ohhh. I know who he is now... southern accent.. hmm interesting. Did you watch this at the Theater ? <|endoftext|> I actually saw it at home. It would definitely be good to see at home or in theater's. <|endoftext|> Is it streaming on Netflix? <|endoftext|> Not yet. You can it on Amazon Prime for $3.99 and probably also through your cable provider. <|endoftext|> You think its worth the cost then? <|endoftext|> Definitely!

It's just me and my dog spot. <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you saw that you loved? <|endoftext|> The last movie I saw that I loved was Rocky 3.

When the police refuse to believe her story, she decides to take matters into her own hands and fight back. <|endoftext|> Oh wow, that sounds interesting <|endoftext|> or Artemis Fowl <|endoftext|> I have not heard of that one. What's it about? <|endoftext|> Artemis Fowl is a 12-year-old genius and descendant of a long line of criminal masterminds. He soon finds himself in an epic battle against a race of powerful underground fairies who may be behind his father's disappearance. <|endoftext|> That one sounds fun--I like that there are fairies in it. <|endoftext|> how about Underwater <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of that one either <|endoftext|> Disaster strikes more than six miles below the ocean surface when water crashes through the walls of a drilling station. Led by their captain, the survivors realize that their only hope is to walk across the sea floor to reach the main part of the facility. But they soon find themselves in a fight for their lives when they come under attack from mysterious and deadly creatures that no one has ever seen. <|endoftext|> Sounds intense---I like it <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Hi!

Do you have a preference in actors or directors? <|endoftext|> Actually yes! I love both M. Night Shyamalan and Mike Flanagan. I think they're two of the most underrated directors out there who know how to tell a suspenseful story without relying on jump scares and gore. <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie the gift? <|endoftext|> I actually have not! Can you tell me a little bit about it, starting with the plot? <|endoftext|> It's about this couple who's lives are thrown into a tailspin when an acquaintance from the past brings mysterious gifts and a horrifying secret. <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting, actually. Can you tell me who stars in it and is it a newer film or older? <|endoftext|> Rebecca Hall, Jason Bateman, Tim Griffin <|endoftext|> I really like Jason Bateman as an actor and a director. Speaking of directors, do you know who directed The Gift? <|endoftext|> Joel Edgerton <|endoftext|> I haven't heard of him but the plot sounds interesting enough. Do you know the film's MPAA rating? <|endoftext|> Rated R <|endoftext|> Right up my alley! I will definitely accept your recommendation and give it a watch. The plot itself and Jason Bateman were huge selling points for me. I'm excited to see it! <|endoftext|> So would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I'd love to watch it!

I liked him in Parks and Rec. I enjoy the Guardians movies. He is a bit one-dimensional, but funny <|endoftext|> True, but show is Jesse Eisenburg <|endoftext|> agree, not my favorite, but I did enjoy zombieland overall <|endoftext|> I'm going to try to watch The Squid and the Whale, and that has Mr. Eisenburg in it.

I never say never. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hello, I'm looking for movie trailer ideas <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you prefer? <|endoftext|> I really like auteur movies in most categories, as well as some comedies <|endoftext|> Can you name one that you liked  as an example? <|endoftext|> Not necessarily one movie, but movies by certain directors or writers. I like Tarantino movies a lot for example <|endoftext|> He is a lot like Scorcese - so I would recommend The Irishman <|endoftext|> Yes, I've heard a lot of good things about that and it's on my list. I'm also looking for movies that are similar but maybe not as popular <|endoftext|> Then how about El Camino? <|endoftext|> I recently watched that one, it was great! Do you have any recommendations for older movies I may enjoy? <|endoftext|> Try looking at Goodfellas <|endoftext|> One of my favorites, mob movies are great. I've seen that, Casino, and Godfather, but I'm unsure of any others. I think the Irishman is a good place to start though <|endoftext|> Good then sounds like you are good to go <|endoftext|> Yes thank you! <|endoftext|> you're welcome - bye now <|endoftext|> good bye! <|endoftext|> Will you be watching the trailer now? <|endoftext|> Yes, I don't think I've seen it, or at least not in a long time <|endoftext|> It has not been out vry long <|endoftext|> Oh I meant the trailer, I'm not sure if I've seen that yeat <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello how are you today? <|endoftext|> I'm well, thanks <|endoftext|> Great, what type of movies do you like <|endoftext|> I like a lot of different movies.Let's try drama <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> A Clockwork Orange, I think. Can you recommend a movie like that? <|endoftext|> What did you enjoy most about A Clockwork Orange <|endoftext|> I liked that it was a Kubrick movie, of course. And that it was inventive <|endoftext|> and what do you least enjoy about the film? <|endoftext|> I don't know. I guess the QUOTATION_MARKfutureQUOTATION_MARK portrayed seemed a little dated <|endoftext|> I think you may enjoy another film from Kubrick <|endoftext|> OK, let's hear it <|endoftext|> Full Metal Jacket <|endoftext|> That's a good one. I accept <|endoftext|> Perfect enjoy the trailer <|endoftext|> Ok thanks <|endoftext|> It is an excellent movie <|endoftext|> Yes, it is. I've seen it before <|endoftext|> Enjoy it <|endoftext|> I'm sure I will <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi, I would like to get some movie recommendations <|endoftext|> Ok, tell me what type of movies do you like to watch and in what genre. <|endoftext|> I love superhero movies. <|endoftext|> Superhero movies are always good to watch have you seen any movies lately. <|endoftext|> I've seen all the Marvel Cinamanic Universe movies (MCU) and last night I saw Shazam! <|endoftext|> I have seen Shazam too it was really good and had a bit of comedy added to it I especially like how much trouble he got into while testing out his powers. <|endoftext|> I loved the comedy part of it too. I usually don't like DC movies because they lack humor, but this movie had that. <|endoftext|> Since you said that you love Superhero movies would you like to see a movie trailer that I would recommend I think you would find it to be very exciting to watch. <|endoftext|> Yes please. <|endoftext|> I would recommend that you see the Dark Phoenix movie trailer. <|endoftext|> That's actually a movie I have not seen yet, even though I've seen a lot of the X Men movie. Thank you! <|endoftext|> So you would like to watch this movie trailer, great if you do it will not disappoint. <|endoftext|> Yes. I just watched it. It looks great.

I really didn't think there were a lot of movies that I would like to see. I hope you have a wonderful holiday season! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> I'm here to discuss movie preferences with you. What is the most recent movie you have seen? My most recent is IT chapter 2. <|endoftext|> Frozen 2 <|endoftext|> My daughter want's to see that, I might actually be taking her this weekend. <|endoftext|> Saw it last night. It was good. I still thought the first one was better though. <|endoftext|> That can often be the case with some series. Like Men in Black, I still think the 1st was the best. <|endoftext|> Same here <|endoftext|> What do you think is next on your list to see? I think I am waiting for Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker. <|endoftext|> That's probably going to be my next, unless my wife can talk me into Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. <|endoftext|> What's your all time favorite movie? Mine is the Shawshank Redemption. <|endoftext|> Ooh, that's a tough one. It may be Raising Arizona. <|endoftext|> Yeah. I too have many close seconds, but the story in Shawshank Redemption is just great to me. Hard to find movies today that are just a great story and not all action and graffics. <|endoftext|> Yes, I love that movie too. Also Braveheart, Saving Private Ryan (big Tom Hanks fan) <|endoftext|> Yes. Tom Hanks has been great in a variety of rolls. I especially liked him in The Green Mile. <|endoftext|> Another good one. Big may be my all time favorite of his, and Joe vs. the Volcano close second. <|endoftext|> Toy Story 4, think you will see that? <|endoftext|> My wife wants to take our son to it. He may be a little young still so not sure. <|endoftext|> My daughter has loved all the Toy Story Movies, I think he'd enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Ok. I think we may try it then. Thanks for the suggestion. <|endoftext|> Indeed. It's been a pleasure talking to you! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! <|endoftext|> Greetings, how are you? <|endoftext|> I am fantastic! Hope you are too. Have you watched any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Not really, I'm looking for something to watch though, can you recommend something? In the mood for a superhero movie. <|endoftext|> Yes, I highly recommend Avengers End Game. This movie was great and full of action. Have you heard of it? <|endoftext|> I've heard of it, haven't seen it. It's one with Iron Man? <|endoftext|> Yes, Iron Man, Black Widow, Captain America, Thor and many more. It's a really good movie and if you like superhero this is perfect. <|endoftext|> Wow, it's got a bunch of superheroes. I'm guessing it's a Marvel movie? <|endoftext|> Yes, it is a Marvel movie. I love that Robert Downy Jr. stars in it too. I really enjoyed watching the Iron Man series. I surely hope you watch it because I believe you would really enjoy that movie. <|endoftext|> I like Robert Downey Jr., he was great in Iron Man. You said it's called Avengers End Game, wondering if I should start at the beginning of the Avengers movies. <|endoftext|> Probably a good idea so you have the basis. <|endoftext|> Does it also include the Incredible Hulk? Seems like he's also a Stan Lee creation. I used to watch the series back in the early nineteen eighties. <|endoftext|> Yes, the Hulk comes out to play in end game. I love Stan Lee he was such an awesome creator. <|endoftext|> I like it how Stan Lee makes cameos in a lot of Marvel movies. I've got nothing to do this week, I'll probably watch the Avengers movies. <|endoftext|> I love that about Stan. I recommend you watch the Avengers End Game trailer. Would you be interested in watching it? <|endoftext|> Yes, I accept your recommendation of the Avengers End game. <|endoftext|> Awesome! I surely hope you enjoy it :) <|endoftext|> If it's called end game, does that mean it's the last one? If it's good, I hope they continue making more somehow <|endoftext|> No it is not the last one. It's part of phase 3. It's funny and interesting how all these movies intertwine with one another. <|endoftext|> You got me very interested in this series, I look forward to watching them. Thank you for your advice <|endoftext|> You're welcome. <|endoftext|> I need to go, have a nice day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? <|endoftext|> hi im good you <|endoftext|> What kind of movies are you interested in <|endoftext|> horror, one that challenges me to open my eyes to things i dont see naturally <|endoftext|> What was the latest horror movie you watched? <|endoftext|> i believe inception and Mirrors <|endoftext|> Inception with leanordo dicaprio? <|endoftext|> I have also watched incidious really likes that one <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen Zombieland? <|endoftext|> no i havent whats it about <|endoftext|> It is about a set of survivors that have to make their own way after a Zombie apocalypse. It mixes horror and comedy at the same time, it is not your usual zombie movie. It stars Woody Harrleson and also co-stars Bill Murray <|endoftext|> oh ok thats cool. i dont like the mix of horror and comedy much though <|endoftext|> You should give this one a try though. It is famous for the pharse of QUOTATION_MARKDouble TapQUOTATION_MARK when it comes to Zombie killing. <|endoftext|> ok is it scary like incidious or thriller walking dead <|endoftext|> Hmmmm, I would say it is more like Walking Dead. If  that is not your preference, have you seen the new IT movie? <|endoftext|> no i havent whats that about. i may watch zombieland at a seperate time <|endoftext|> IT is adapted form teh Stephen King book of the same name. It is about a group of kids that are chaed by a demon that manifests itself as an evil and Bloodthirsty clown. It was originally a TV mini-series back in the 90s...but then was made into a feature film last year. There is a sequel out now called QUOTATION_MARKIT, Chapter TwoQUOTATION_MARK. This is a pretty scary movie by comparison. <|endoftext|> ok yes i may watch that one <|endoftext|> Ok, well enjoy IT and Zombieland! <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, I am here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi! What movies do you recommend? <|endoftext|> Well, that all depends on what kind of movies interest you. <|endoftext|> I like comedies, rom-coms, etc. I also love documentaries. <|endoftext|> Could I ask what was the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was Bridesmaids. <|endoftext|> I watched that with my girlfriend and it was hilarious. I want to recommend a rom-com called Last Christmas. It stars Emilia Clark from Game of Thrones. I really like her. <|endoftext|> Sounds like a good movie for the holiday season! I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> That sounds great! <|endoftext|> Do you have any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> You said that you liked documentaries, so which type of those is your favorite <|endoftext|> I recently watched the two documentaries about the Fyre Festival on Hulu and Netflix and liked both of those. I like things related to current events and I also love true crime docs <|endoftext|> I also really enjoy true crime docs. One of my favorites is Making A Murderer, would you be interested in seeing that trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes! I have been meaning to watch that one. <|endoftext|> Unfortunately the Making A Murderer trailer is unavailable, I can continue to find a documentary trailer that might interest you or we could try something else. <|endoftext|> Sure, we can try other documentaries. <|endoftext|> I may have just what you are looking for. It is very similar to the fyre festival doc. It's called The Inventor: Out For Blood In Silicon Valley. I really recommend this one. <|endoftext|> That sounds really interesting; what's it about? <|endoftext|> It's about a woman who is creating a new piece of technology that could revolutionize modern medicine, and all the twists and turns in trying to develop something that could change the world. <|endoftext|> I'll have to watch that one, too. I also accept that recommendation. Thank you! <|endoftext|> Sorry do disappoint you again, but I'm not having any luck finding that trailer either. I think documentaries might not be able to be viewed for some reason. <|endoftext|> No problem! Thanks for the recommendation for the Last Christmas movie. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today? Did you have a nice Thanksgiving? What movies did you get to watch over the Thanksgiving weekend? <|endoftext|> I'm good thanks! I had a pretty good holiday. Unfortunately I didn't get to watch any movies but I really wanted to see Knives Out. I might see it later this month. <|endoftext|> I haven't got to see it yet either. I have seen the previews and saw the live interview with Jamie Lee Curtis for Knives Out. Agatha Christie mysteries are wonderful. I hope you get to see it later this month from the previews, it is going to be a really great movie. <|endoftext|> Definitely. I really like the suspense of the QUOTATION_MARKwho-dun-itQUOTATION_MARK and the cast looks really good too. Do you have any other recommendations that would be similar to Knives Out? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Game Night with Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams? It is a murder mystery, also. <|endoftext|> I have not! Murder mystery is exactly what I'm looking for, can you tell me a little more about the movie? <|endoftext|> The movie follows a group of friends who participate in a couples\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd game night every week.

As Max, Annie and their competitive couple-friends set out to solve the mystery and rescue Brooks, they discover something unknown about Brooks and the game. The movie received praise for its tight plotting that delivered genuinely shocking twists and turns and its ability to land silly humor at the same time. <|endoftext|> That sounds pretty interesting, I might have to check it out. Does it have a romance plot in the movie? <|endoftext|> Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams play Max and Annie who are a couple in the movie. <|endoftext|> That's good, I enjoy movies that have a romantic touch to them. You know what? You've convinced me, I am definitely going to watch this movie. I accept your recommendation! <|endoftext|> That's marvelous. I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thanks! If I enjoy that movie, are there any others that I should check out? <|endoftext|> Do you like older mystery movies? Or the newer ones only? <|endoftext|> I like both! But I'm interested in hearing about older ones <|endoftext|> You would probably like Mirror Crack'd if you like Agatha Christie. Angela Lansbury play's Miss Marple in a quaint British town. Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor in her last role and Tony Curtis are, also lead roles in this mystery movie. <|endoftext|> Those sound very cool, do they have a lot of action in them? <|endoftext|> Probably no as much as you the would like with Angela Lansbury. You might like Murder on the Orient Express better with Poirot. <|endoftext|> I think I've heard of that one. It has Judi Dench right? I enjoy her movies a lot. Does that movie have a good cast with her? <|endoftext|> It has the following cast:  Olivia Colman, Pen\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdlope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Daisy Ridley, Leslie Odom Jr., Josh Gad, Michelle Pfeiffer, Lucy Boynton, and Johnny Depp. You be the judge of the cast. <|endoftext|> That sounds very good! I accept your recommendation. Thanks so much! I think I will enjoy both of those movies. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi!! How are you doing this evening? <|endoftext|> Hi i am well how about you <|endoftext|> I am amazing, thank you for asking! I am here to help you pick a movie trailer <|endoftext|> I like movies about world war ii <|endoftext|> World War II Movies are great!. What is the last WWII movie you watched? <|endoftext|> i saw midway <|endoftext|> Are you wanting a similar story line to Midway or you looking for something a bit different? <|endoftext|> similar storyline <|endoftext|> Got it <|endoftext|> do you have one in mind? <|endoftext|> Have you ever seen The Pacific? <|endoftext|> no but i accept your reccommendation <|endoftext|> Great!. It's got so much Action and History that you will just love! <|endoftext|> i hope i love it <|endoftext|> You will. Is there anything else I can help you with? <|endoftext|> not that i know of <|endoftext|> You have a great evening and enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> you as well! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> i will watch the movie soon <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Hey! I am doing well. How about you? <|endoftext|> Great! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. Do you have any movie preferences? <|endoftext|> I love comedies and dramas. Do you have a recommendation? <|endoftext|> Yes. I just watched Light Night starring Emma Thompson and Mindy Kaling. It was pretty funny and a fun female comedy. <|endoftext|> I have never heard of it, but I like both of the actresses. Can you tell me a bit about the story line? <|endoftext|> Mindy Kaling's character is a quality control speciality at a plant, but she wants to get into comedy writing. The story centers on her getting a job for Emma Thompson's character, who is a talk show host and really hard to work for. <|endoftext|> That sounds pretty good. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Awesome! I hope you enjoy watching the trailer. <|endoftext|> Thank you! I am sure I will. <|endoftext|> Do you want me to recommend a drama movie as well? <|endoftext|> Yes please! <|endoftext|> I watched a movie about a month ago that was a drama/comedy that had me dying of laughter. It's called What we did on our holiday. <|endoftext|> Interesting. I have never heard of that either. Is it a Christmas movie? Or do they mean holiday as in vacation? <|endoftext|> It's british, so they mean vacation. It has David Tennant and Rosamund Pike. They play a couple on the brink of divorce who take their kids to his dying father's 75th birthday in Scotland. <|endoftext|> I LOVE David Tennant so I would watch it just for that! I actually think I may have seen the trailer for it. Do you know where I can find it? <|endoftext|> I think youtube has a trailer for it. It has some slightly dark humor, but it is so funny. <|endoftext|> Perfect! I love dark humor. I will check out both of these recommendations. Thanks! <|endoftext|> You are welcome! Glad I could recommend good movies! <|endoftext|> Me too! have a great day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, are you looking for a movie trailer to watch? <|endoftext|> Yes. What can you recommend? <|endoftext|> Are you interested on any genre in particular? Animatin, or adventure perhaps, the new Star Wars trailer just came out. It has new images of the Knights of Ren <|endoftext|> Star Wars is OK. I think people tend to focus more on the effects than the actual movie. I think a good rom com or a good mystery. <|endoftext|> Got it, becuse of the season most of your Romantic Comedies will be focus on Christmas, Last Christmas is one of them, it has Emma Thompson on a leading role and it focuses on the love that grows between a boss and an emplyee during the Christmas break <|endoftext|> Yes. I'd like to see that movie. I've heard there's a twist, but I don't know what it is. <|endoftext|> i really dont want to spoiled it for you, it really looks good, now on to mistery. This holiday season brings a couple of suspense flicks to the screen: one of them is Knives out. with a current score of 98% on rotten tomatoes it is sure to be a hit <|endoftext|> I saw that one already. It has good parts and a great twist, but it tends to drag. <|endoftext|> i understand, so Last Christmas with Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones interestes you? <|endoftext|> Yes, it sounds like a good movie. <|endoftext|> excellent, i hope you enjoy the trailer <|endoftext|> Thanks. What I've seen has been good so far. <|endoftext|> here is a little sniped of the movie <|endoftext|> Huh? I don't see the link. What happened to it? <|endoftext|> Kate is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Her last date with disaster? That of having accepted to work as Santa's elf for a department store. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn. For Kate, it seems too good to be true. <|endoftext|> Do they say in the movie why she's so inclined to bad decisions? <|endoftext|> she(Emilia Clarke) just seem to make bad decision after another. Part of the whole Rom Com thing  i guess. <|endoftext|> Is it super cheesy like most rom coms, with some speech to a bunch of random people, that most people wouldn't do in real life? <|endoftext|> no it really seams to be a good movie, the cast is good and the truth is that movies like this only are good around Christmas. i hope you enjoy your movie <|endoftext|> Do you have any other good recommendations? <|endoftext|> i just watched Frozzen @ this Friday it was really good, Pretty funny to be honest <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey there, how are you? <|endoftext|> Great! I'm looking for a good movie to watch <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you like watching? <|endoftext|> Comedy <|endoftext|> What is the last movie you watched and enjoyed? <|endoftext|> Disney's Coco <|endoftext|> Aw, love that one! My kids love it to!! <|endoftext|> Me too! I like cartoons <|endoftext|> Im going to find you the perfect movie!! <|endoftext|> Thanks so much! <|endoftext|> I think I have the perfect movie, I hope you havnt seen it yet!! <|endoftext|> What is it? <|endoftext|> Despicable Me 2! funny, cartoon and a great movie all around!! <|endoftext|> Oh yes! I love Steve Carell <|endoftext|> Yes, he is hilarious in all his movies! I really love Miranda Cosgrove, she reminds me of my child hood! <|endoftext|> I love her too! Thank for the recommendation-I will watch Despicable Me 2 <|endoftext|> Perfect, I hope you love it as much as we do!! <|endoftext|> Thanks so much for your help. Have a great day! <|endoftext|> You have a great day too!! <|endoftext|> Thanks again <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi. What kind of movies are you looking for? <|endoftext|> Comedy or Actions are my favorites <|endoftext|> Those are both great genres. Are you in the mood for one or the other? <|endoftext|> Ehh well honestly I would love to watch a good comedy right now, tough day so need to laugh about stuff haha. <|endoftext|> I'm sorry to hear that. Movies are a great way to unwind. Are there any particular actors that you like? <|endoftext|> I have quite a few actors that I like, Bruce Willis, Leonardo Decaprio, Jim Carrey, Seth Rogan, Paul Rudd, Tom Hardy, Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Christian Bale, and thats not even scratching the top, if they're a good actor I most likely enjoy them <|endoftext|> I recently saw a movie I haven't seen in a long time with Paul Rudd. Have you seen This is 40? <|endoftext|> Yeah I've seen This Is 40, I guess im looking for something a little more released in the last two years comedy movie <|endoftext|> How about Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle? You mentioned The Rock and he's in that one. <|endoftext|> Actually doesn't sound bad to watch right now, funny and ain't to serious sounds great right now <|endoftext|> Excellent. I have a trailer queued up for you when our chat is over. <|endoftext|> Sounds great! <|endoftext|> So then you're accepting the recommendation? I'll see where it's available. <|endoftext|> Yeah i'm accepting the recommendation <|endoftext|> Excellent! Looks like it's on Amazon Prime and if you have a Starz subscription it will be on there too. Enjoy! <|endoftext|> Awesome, got both. I appreciate it. You have a wonderful night! <|endoftext|> You too! Hope your night improves. <|endoftext|> Yeah I hope you have a good night also! try not to go nuts doing this haha <|endoftext|> It's a fun distraction. But it does seem to be never ending ... <|endoftext|> Basically why I started also, a good little distraction from the chaos of the day!! Well again I appreciate you taking the time to recommend stuff to me, and I hope you have a wonderful night! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer, have you seen good movies lately? <|endoftext|> I have, but mostly older movies. <|endoftext|> Any older movies in particular? How old? <|endoftext|> I recently watched QUOTATION_MARKThe ScoreQUOTATION_MARK which was made in 2001, with Robert DeNiro and Edward Norton, directed by Frank Oz. It was excellent. <|endoftext|> I like Robert De Niro, I saw that he has a movie coming out on Netflix called QUOTATION_MARKThe Irishman.QUOTATION_MARK Tempted to watch it. <|endoftext|> I'm not familiar with that one, is it a Scorcese movie? <|endoftext|> Yes it is. Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro have made a lot of movies together, nine I think. <|endoftext|> Interesting, is it a crime-drama type film? <|endoftext|> I believe so, it's described as an epic crime film <|endoftext|> Has it already been released in theaters? <|endoftext|> It was released on November 1, 2019. <|endoftext|> Wasn't there another recent Scorcese film, Motherless Brooklyn? Or was that a different director? <|endoftext|> Motherless Brooklyn was directed by Edward Norton. Starring Bruce Willis <|endoftext|> Okay, I must have been thinking about an interview with Scorcese that mentioned Motherless Brooklyn. Did Motherless Brooklyn receive positive reviews? <|endoftext|> One critic said it requires a lot of patience to watch, but it has strong performances, and an interesting perspective. Most of the critics say it's an average movie. <|endoftext|> How has QUOTATION_MARKThe IrishmanQUOTATION_MARK been received critically? <|endoftext|> The ratings are pretty high, most people giving it around eight out of ten stars. One person called it an epic gangster drama. Sounds kind of typical for a Scorsese film <|endoftext|> Okay, I accept your recommendation, I would be interested in watching the trailer for QUOTATION_MARKThe IrishmanQUOTATION_MARK <|endoftext|> Great, I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|> Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi im going to try and find you a good movie to watch <|endoftext|> Excellent! I love movies that are witty and make you think a lot or challenge you to think about society or whatnot <|endoftext|> That's great! Me too! So tell what is something you watched recently and loved? <|endoftext|> hmmm lol not a lot of great stuff. I think the last movie that I felt satisfied with was Ready or Not. But I also liked John Wick for the mindless violence and action lol <|endoftext|> Noted i'll have to check more into Ready or Not. I am a big fan of John Wick. The first movie that came to mind is Joker. In reference to thinking about society. <|endoftext|> Which Joker Movie? The one with Health Ledger or the most recent movie? <|endoftext|> The most recent movie. It's just called 'Joker'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend. <|endoftext|> Interested. I do love dark movies and dark humor as well. Would you mind being more specific in terms of how they portray societies role? In other words, whom do they take stabs at? LOL <|endoftext|> It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything. <|endoftext|> Ha ha ha. Fair enough. My fear with that movie was that it would turn out like Suicide Squad which had great potential but fell far short from expectations. I also stray away from comic book movies, however DC has kept me more entertained with how dark they seem to be. Would you say that this movie would be closer to Suicide Squad, or closer to the Dark Knight? <|endoftext|> Suicide Squad was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real. <|endoftext|> EXCELLENT!! you had me sold when you said Suicide squad was garbage! I accept your recommendation. I saw the Director also said to watch it as a completely independent movie as well. Is this movie friendly for the more religious side of ones family? I have a few Zealots and want to know what too expect so I can stave off their constant state of being offended lol. <|endoftext|> I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really. But i am biased i'm pretty agnostic so i dont watch for it much. I'd be more worried about becoming anarchist after watching it then any religious aspect. <|endoftext|> Noted. Well I certainly appreciate the recommendation! Any other last second recommendations? I mean you love John Wick and the Joker I was already considering but hadn't decided. So, It seems we have similar tastes. <|endoftext|> Hmm well as for some solid gems on Netflix, check out Tau and Ex Machina they're both sifi but on the dark side. Also as far Joaquin Phoenix goes the movie 'Her' is fantastic and will make you cry. lol <|endoftext|> I have heard of the movie Her. I will also watch that one. I really appreciate the recomendations. A lot of junk out there and no real guidance. Thank you and take care. <|endoftext|> I hope you like them. You too. <|endoftext|> one last thing!! What is Ex Machina about? <|endoftext|> About this guy who goes on a secret job at some genius's house to help him see if his AI passed the turing test. <|endoftext|> I was reading about it while you replied earlier an It was not very clear lol . You said sifi, futuristic I presume? <|endoftext|> Yes but not to far future. Im a sucker for science fiction. As long as it's good. <|endoftext|> I know what you mean by QUOTATION_MARKas long as it's goodQUOTATION_MARK. I was most recently very disappointed in Zombieland Double Tap. I felt they tried to hard to replicate the chemistry and humor but failed miserably. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey, I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> great, thank you <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to view? <|endoftext|> I really like movies based on history or historical figures <|endoftext|> What's the last movie you watched and would you want one with a similar story or a different one? <|endoftext|> The last film I saw was that Freddie Mercury movie Bohemian Rhapsody <|endoftext|> Do you want a movie with a similar story or different one? <|endoftext|> Similar would be fine <|endoftext|> Since you said you like history or historical figures, I think I have an idea of a movie for you to watch. <|endoftext|> That would be great, I appreciate it <|endoftext|> What about the movie Judy? <|endoftext|> That's a good idea, about Judy Garland, I forgot about that one. Wasn't the actress nominated for an Oscar? I don't know much about Judy Garland, so that would be a good way to learn something too <|endoftext|> Yes, that was the actress. So would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I think I would, yes <|endoftext|> Are you planning on watching the movie tonight? <|endoftext|> I might if it looks interesting, I have no plans <|endoftext|> Just so I can make sure I have an extra genre just in case, what genre do you like the most after history/historical figures? <|endoftext|> I like crime dramas or mysteries <|endoftext|> Yes, I love those as well! Good to know, thanks! <|endoftext|> sure, thank you <|endoftext|> Since you like crime drama/mystery, I'm going to send you the trailer to the movie Dolores Claiborne. I have a really good trailer of that on hand instead. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Good morning. How are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. How are you? <|endoftext|> Great! Thank you. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I prefer comedy and action. I also watch fantasy and childrens movies as I have two young daughters <|endoftext|> I have little kids too! We watch kids movies all the time. Have you seen new Frozen? <|endoftext|> We have not! I know my five year old really wants to <|endoftext|> OMG! You really have to! I have boys and they enjoed it sooo much. It is a super cute movie for adults too. <|endoftext|> We will definitely go and see it! I really enjoyed the first frozen. We've watched that probably 20 times since disney+ was released <|endoftext|> It is so great. Are your girls into any particular Disney movies? Do they like Toy Story movies? <|endoftext|> they like the princesses more than anything. My youngest is really stuck on QUOTATION_MARKjessieQUOTATION_MARK from toy story right now <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch Frozen trailer? <|endoftext|> yes i would! The trailer looks wonderful! I will accept your recommendation and take my girls to see it this afternoon. Thank you! <|endoftext|> That's great. Hope they will love it as much as we did. <|endoftext|> im certain we will. thanks for taking the time to talk to me! have a great day <|endoftext|> You too! Be prepared to have to get bunch of Frozen stuff for Christmas. <|endoftext|> I havent done much christmas shopping at all. procrastination at its finest <|endoftext|> Funny you said LOL I have not bought one thing. I have 2 boys and a little one year old girl. I should probably get busy LOL <|endoftext|> my girls are home from school today with a cough and they both just came out dressed as anna and elsa lol this is perfect <|endoftext|> Hope they get well soon. Thats great. I hope you will have nice Christmas with your family. <|endoftext|> same to you! merry christmas <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you? <|endoftext|> Hi I'm good. I was thinking about seeing a movie <|endoftext|> Awesome! What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I like cerebral thriller/action, foreign films, comedies <|endoftext|> I also love thrillers and foreign films! Are you familiar with South Korean cinema? They have some awesome thrillers <|endoftext|> I've seen Chan-park wook films, which are actually some of my favoraties <|endoftext|> That's really cool! Have you seen The handmaid's tale? It's his latest movie and I really enjoyed it <|endoftext|> I've heard of it. Is it like QUOTATION_MARKThirstQUOTATION_MARK or QUOTATION_MARKOldboyQUOTATION_MARK or any of his other good ones? <|endoftext|> It has a much more QUOTATION_MARKgothicQUOTATION_MARK aesthetic and it has a bit less action than oldboy but I would say it's just as good in its own way <|endoftext|> Is the music good? I liked his use of Phillip glass, Vivaldi, in previous films <|endoftext|> It's a little underwhelming actually. Have you seen Joker thou? The music is really good on that one and the tone is very similar to Sympathy for Mr Vengeance <|endoftext|> I haven't, but I liked the Nolan QUOTATION_MARKdark knightQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARK.. RisesQUOTATION_MARK too much to taint it. How do you rate Joker and Handmaiden? <|endoftext|> I'd say joker is a bit better, the cinematography is really beautiful. It's a bit less action focused than the dark knight but just as good! <|endoftext|> Can it easily be interpreted totally separate from th Nolan films? <|endoftext|> oh yes, it's a separate origin story that deals exclusively with the joker <|endoftext|> I'd see that and Handmaiden. Is handmaiden more positive? <|endoftext|> I'd say Joker is better. Handmaiden is a bit slower and it's difficult not to compare it to Oldboy. <|endoftext|> I think I will see Joker, thank you <|endoftext|> Awesome! It was great chatting with you! <|endoftext|> you too <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! I'm here today to help you with a movie recommendation! What genre of movies fo you prefer? <|endoftext|> I romantic comedies. And, hello! <|endoftext|> What's the latest romantic comedy that you've seen? <|endoftext|> Brittany runs a Marathon <|endoftext|> I've never seen that one before! I'd recommend How To Lose a Guy In Ten Days. It's probably my all time favorite. <|endoftext|> I'll have to check it out. Who's in it? <|endoftext|> Kate Hudson and Matthew McCognehy (probably misspelled but hopefully you understand.) They truly have this on screen vibe and it's wonderful. <|endoftext|> Love Kate Hudson. I can take or leave MM, I can't shake the commercials out of my head. <|endoftext|> Me either, but I really enjoyed their pairing in this movie. It's really great. I think you'll love it. <|endoftext|> Thanks,I'll check it out. <|endoftext|> I'll send you the trailer! It's really great! <|endoftext|> I'd appreciate it. <|endoftext|> I'll send it right over. It's loading :) <|endoftext|> still loading? <|endoftext|> Yeah, it is! Sorry about that! <|endoftext|> It's taking quite a while <|endoftext|> I'm honestly not sure what's going on.. <|endoftext|> I think we're done then. <|endoftext|> I guess? I'm not sure. It just won't load. <|endoftext|> accept the recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello,  I am here to recommend a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hello! What movie is it? <|endoftext|> It depends on your preferences. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I enjoy action and comedy. I don't like sad movies <|endoftext|> Do you like Dwayne the Rock Johnson? <|endoftext|> Very much so <|endoftext|> Do you like Kevin Hart <|endoftext|> Yes! He's very funny. I like movies when they act together <|endoftext|> They have a movie coming up.It is the latest in the Jumanji series. <|endoftext|> Oh I loved the first one! I bet this one will be good too. Thank you! I accept this recommendation <|endoftext|> Great. It also have Danny Devito and Danny Glover <|endoftext|> Danny Devito is very funny. I like when he and the Rock act together. Are there any female leads in this one? <|endoftext|> Yes. Karen Gillian. She plays a commando avatar <|endoftext|> Has she been in many action movies before? <|endoftext|> She played Nebula Guardians of the Galaxy <|endoftext|> That's also a funny movie with lots of action. Do you remember who the lead actor in that one is? <|endoftext|> Chris Pratt played Peter Quill <|endoftext|> He is good at action and comedy. <|endoftext|> Yes. Enjoy the trailer. Signing off <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hi <|endoftext|> Hi there!

He spends most of his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth, his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt double.

My recent favorite is Avengers Infinity War <|endoftext|> Oh that was a parody movie... was hilarious af. Marvel movies are dope though <|endoftext|> i have seen the scary movie though.. Anna Farris was great <|endoftext|> So action/comic movies.... did you see endgame? Don't you think if cap went back in time and relived his life normally that it would be a different string of history and a different universe/reality? <|endoftext|> i feel like his future self was always there throught out the events of other avenger movies. You could see him as one of the people when Peggy Carter dies. <|endoftext|> I like that theory <|endoftext|> I do like the concept of multiple universes and those things are super intriguing <|endoftext|> I have a ridiculous recommendation for you. I hope you like it <|endoftext|> shoot.. tell me! <|endoftext|> I'll get to that, do you like comedies? <|endoftext|> yes i do like comedies <|endoftext|> Have you seen airplane?

I know its on Netflix in the states if you're here too. <|endoftext|> I am 31 but i moved to US like 5 years ago.. I will check it out on Netflix.

It stars Daniel Kaluuya, Allison Williams, Lil Rel Howery <|endoftext|> Nice! I think I have seen some of Jordan Peele's other flicks. Do like them? <|endoftext|> yes i also do.

Were the songs good? <|endoftext|> it has a good story and the graphics were legit. <|endoftext|> Will there be any surprises in the plot of the Lion King to look forward to? Aladdin deviated from the original some which made it more entertaining. <|endoftext|> ahh the lion king is pretty much the same plot as the first one. lol but just cool the way the made the movie <|endoftext|> Oh okay! Lion King was actually the first movie I received as a kid (on VHS) so it holds a special place in my heart. Would you say it's a movie the whole family would enjoy?

His stories csn be summed up and told in the dark. <|endoftext|> True! I have a friend who usually doesn't watch horror, and she loved it! <|endoftext|> It is a good way to QUOTATION_MARKgentlyQUOTATION_MARK scare people. My daughter likes true stories told in the dark rather than fiction. <|endoftext|> Ah, that's how to do it! Now how about romance genres? What kinds of movies have you seen on that front? <|endoftext|> The Fifty shades of gray series, You before me, the fault in our stars, etc.. I like Hallmark romance movies also. <|endoftext|> Classics! Of course, there are still some elements of romance in Scary stories to tell in the dark, although it still focuses on the horror and thriller aspects <|endoftext|> That they are indeed. Movies to watch again and again. What can you recommend for me? <|endoftext|> well, do you think you would want to watch the trailer for scary stories to tell in the dark? <|endoftext|> I certainly would :-) <|endoftext|> Perfect!

I thank you again for recommending scary stories to tell in the dark. I will check that out. Have a great holiday. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you find a movie! <|endoftext|> Great! Honestly my favorite type of movies are ones where theres a lot of action and something to get the nerves going but at the same time theres that little bit of romance going on you can see coming at the end <|endoftext|> Oh, I really like those movies too! What was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The most recent movie I watched was Jumanji, been a great movie since I was a kid and seeing an QUOTATION_MARKadultQUOTATION_MARK type with some of my favorite actors dwayne johnson and kevin hart was the best <|endoftext|> I have watched Kevin Hart for years and the more he does, the more I love him. I thought his chemistry with Dwayne Johnson on screen was brilliant. Are you looking for a movie with a similar story line? Or would you like to switch it up? <|endoftext|> I always like some new ideas so switching it up would be fine or the same story line doesnt really matter to me. I just love the comedy between the two <|endoftext|> Ah, so what seems to be most important to you is the action mixed with a little thriller but also with a little bit of romance thrown in, am I getting close? <|endoftext|> Yes exactly that! <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I'm happy to hear we are on the same page. I think I have a solid understanding of what you like. Do you like longer or shorter movies? <|endoftext|> Anything is fine to be honest <|endoftext|> Have you considered a movie series? I know you said you like action and romance, I personally feel the romantic story develops better over a longer period of time <|endoftext|> yes of course, what do you recommend? <|endoftext|> The hunger Games series is one of my favorites. It is a little bit of an older film, the first movie having been released in 2012, but I think this series accurately depicts what you are looking for in a movie. Would you like to hear more about it? <|endoftext|> I've always wanted to check the series out i definitely will now! <|endoftext|> I definitely think it's a great choice. There are several in the series. The original movie was nominated for a Golden Globe Award. Would you like to look at any of the other movies in the series? <|endoftext|> Well of course im going to look at all of them <|endoftext|> Great! I recommend starting with the first film. The duration is only 142 minutes, so it won't take up your whole afternoon that way you can still have time to decide if you want to get the other movies in the series. <|endoftext|> Thats great, thank you ill start sometime this week :) <|endoftext|> Wonderful. Here is the movie. Happy watching! <|endoftext|> You too! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, have you watched any movies recently? If so what are your favorites? <|endoftext|> Hello yes I've watched a few movies recently. I saw four christmases which isn't new but was so funny I loved it <|endoftext|> Awesome, thank you for sharing! The movie made 136 million at the box office, which isn't bad. How does four Christmases compare to other Christmas movies you watched? <|endoftext|> I love Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn. I feel it was a real movie in other words not a typical christmas script but real stories with families but just happened to be christmas time. there was a lot of characters and stories going on at once <|endoftext|> Excellent! Thank you so very much for sharing. May I recommend you to QUOTATION_MARKSurviving Christmas (2004), its s similar Movie to which may seem interesting to you. <|endoftext|> I don't recall exactly but I want to say I may have seen that movie or at least some of it. Seems like a fun christmas throwback movie also. If I haven't seen it I will definitely check it out <|endoftext|> Thank you! It seems like a good one to check out, 84% of Google users like the movie, but the movie had a Budget of 45 million, and only made back 15.1 million in the Box Office, which is unfortunate. <|endoftext|> wow they lost a lot of money on that one <|endoftext|> Yeah, not to mention the lost money from all the advertising, that could of been at least an additional $100k - $1 Million lost. <|endoftext|> thats what happens when you pay known actors way too much money for a film <|endoftext|> Indeed, thank you so very much for the excellent conversation, it was a pleasure. Happy viewing! <|endoftext|> Thank you I hope you see some great movies <|endoftext|> Thanks!

Comedy, Drama, Super Hero?? <|endoftext|> i like action movies and horrors too.can you recommend some <|endoftext|> The new version of QUOTATION_MARKThe Invisible ManQUOTATION_MARK comes out next week. It looks truly frightening. It's with Elisabeth Moss. Looks amazing! <|endoftext|> oh really and how are the ratings in public domain? <|endoftext|> There aren't any ratings yet, but Leigh Whannell is the writer. He did the Saw movies, which were amazing! I think it's definitely going to be worth a try! <|endoftext|> can you check for me something else like comedy too. <|endoftext|> Of course! I would recommend QUOTATION_MARKOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood!QUOTATION_MARK It god Brad Pitt an Academy Award this year. There are some truly hilarious scenes in this movie. You'll love it! <|endoftext|> i love that guy,his shows are pretty amazing.when was it released? <|endoftext|> It came out last July. <|endoftext|> i cannot believe i miss it,i will have to check it too.what about horror movies,any new release? <|endoftext|> I would recommend It Chapter 2. It came out in September and it's amazingly scary! <|endoftext|> chapter 2?,who are the staring if i may ask. <|endoftext|> Bill Hader and Jessica Chastain <|endoftext|> my favorite too,i think it is a nice combination of actor characters. <|endoftext|> Definitely! I also love Bill Hader doing a serious role.\\ <|endoftext|> i see,thank you so much,you really made my day,i will check all the list of shows we have discuses one by one. <|endoftext|> Awesome! Good luck! <|endoftext|> if i may ask ,what about a Quiet place movie,someone told me it is nice,have you heard about it? <|endoftext|> A Quiet Place is super scary. It's with John Krasinski and Emily Blunt (real life husband and wife). Reviews are good! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Fine, thanks! And you? <|endoftext|> Wonderful! Can I help you find a movie you'd be interested in today? <|endoftext|> Sure! <|endoftext|> What are some movies you've enjoyed in the past? <|endoftext|> Let's see.... Cinema Paradiso, Raging Bull, Asphalt Jungle.... <|endoftext|> Great, so are you generally interested in foreign films? What are some other genres you appreciate? <|endoftext|> Film Noir, Drama, Rom Coms, Documentary <|endoftext|> Wonderful! I have a few recommendations in the documentary category, first of all. Going Clear is a compelling, shocking account of the controversies and secrets of the Church of Scientology. <|endoftext|> Oh ok - I was considering watching it <|endoftext|> Would seasonal rom coms also tickle your fancy, as Christmas is coming up? <|endoftext|> Maybe, as long as it doesn't get too mushy, lol Two that I like aren't exactly seasonal, but they're hilarious: Best Friends (Goldie Hawn & Burt Reynolds) and Forget Paris (Billy Crystal & Debra Winger) <|endoftext|> Got it! I recommend Love Actually. You seem to like somewhat older/more classic movies. Love Actually is fast paced, as it has multiple plot lines moving at once. There are several plot lines that I find hilarious to break up the more mushy plot lines. It also has a great cast, with actors like Colin Firth and Bill Nighy. How does that sound? <|endoftext|> Yes, I love that one! Very sweet. I am a huge fan of Hugh Grant! <|endoftext|> Yes, he's great in this movie! My favorite part of the movie is the washed up pop star who keeps forgetting the lyrics to his own songs haha. And two porn stars who fall in love! It's irreverent but very wholesome at the same time. Enjoy the movie! <|endoftext|> Thank you - I accept! <|endoftext|> By the way, I hope you have a Merry Christmas and that you get to watch the movie with loved ones around! P.S. it might not be very kid-friendly, but you've already seen it so I'm sure you know that <|endoftext|> Backatcha! I definitely will see it again, thanks! <|endoftext|> Have a great day :) <|endoftext|> You too :-) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi , I would like to recommend a movie trailer for you <|endoftext|> sonic <|endoftext|> What kind of movies do you usually enjoy? <|endoftext|> comedy <|endoftext|> What was the last movie you saw? <|endoftext|> joker <|endoftext|> Are there any actors that you particularly like? <|endoftext|> no i dont <|endoftext|> What did you think of Joker? <|endoftext|> it was great it was telling his life story and how it started <|endoftext|> If you like a little romance with comedy , I think you might like Table 19 <|endoftext|> ill check it out now <|endoftext|> I think good comedies are hard to find <|endoftext|> dave chappelle just had a funny one <|endoftext|> The actors are key in comedies <|endoftext|> not really to me <|endoftext|> I like the cast in Table 19 and think they are very good in it <|endoftext|> give me another  recommendation because i dont just check out table 19 its not my thing <|endoftext|> Once Upon a time in Hollywood is the best movie I have seen this year <|endoftext|> i check that out ok nice talking to you <|endoftext|> You too. <|endoftext|> do you press done <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, do you like to watch movies? <|endoftext|> Yes!

What's the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last one was Downsizing with Matt Damon <|endoftext|> Oh goodness, I saw that. What did you think of it? <|endoftext|> Well it was a little strange, I mean it is out of our idea of what reality is, but I thought it was well executed <|endoftext|> I personally wanted to see more QUOTATION_MARKdoll House sillinessQUOTATION_MARK but it was alright! A good drama sort of thing! <|endoftext|> Yeah for sure <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Martian? Also a drama with Matt Damon in it. <|endoftext|> I actually have not. Have heard good things about it though <|endoftext|> It really is fantastic. The trailer should be enough to get you hooked. He's stuck on mars and has to survive, I don't want to spoil too much! <|endoftext|> I like that idea. Thank you for the recommendation, I am always looking for something new to watch. <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you like it! <|endoftext|> Thanks. Anyone else famous plays in that movie? <|endoftext|> Uh, no one I really know, but Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, and Jeff Daniels are the other actors besides Matt Damon <|endoftext|> Oh I see, I know some of them. Thanks again! <|endoftext|> Of course! I'll click it so it should send it to you soon. <|endoftext|> Awesome sounds good <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there, my name is Jessica and I'll be helping you find a great movie today. How are you today? <|endoftext|> Fine thanks. <|endoftext|> Excellent! In order to help you find the best movie, I would love to know, what was the last movie that you watched most recently? <|endoftext|> I saw Parasite <|endoftext|> Oh great! That movie won the Oscar for Best Picture. What did you like most about the film? <|endoftext|> It had unexpected twists and it was also visually stunning <|endoftext|> Do you usually prefer fiction/fantasy or more real life/nonfiction type plots? <|endoftext|> I prefer fiction but I also enjoy documentaries or movies based on real life events <|endoftext|> Oh that's great! I definitely have some ideas for you now. One more question, do you prefer foreign films with subtitles or does it make no difference for you? <|endoftext|> It doesn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt matter if it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds foreign with subtitles or in English <|endoftext|> Perfect! I have found a great movie for you. Joker starring Joaquin Phoenix and Robert De Niro. You will love the visually stunning aspects and the storyline has many surprises that stray from what we already know about the Joker. <|endoftext|> Thank you I definitely want to see the Joker. I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Excellent! I hope you enjoy the trailer and then you go to see the movie after!:) <|endoftext|> Have you seen the Joker? Did you like it? <|endoftext|> I have! I loved it. It surprised me at many times. At one moment, I almost jumped out of my seat I was so shocked. I also loved the emotional depth that they gave to such an infamous villain. <|endoftext|> It sounds very entertaining and surprising, great. Do you like superhero movies in general? I definitely do. It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds interesting to contemplate the backstory for a nemesis of Batman, too. <|endoftext|> I love superhero movies!! That is one of the aspects I love about this movie too. They start off with a regular guy, Arthur Fleck, and show how he becomes the villain that we know today. <|endoftext|> I was also considering Birds of Prey with the Harlequin character but I think I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll watch the Joker first. <|endoftext|> Yay! I think you'd like both actually. Have you watched the trailer for the Joker yet? <|endoftext|> Not yet but I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm going to momentarily seek it out online. Thanks again for your suggestions. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hey there how is it going? <|endoftext|> Hi! Its good, how are you? Do you have any movies to recommend that I can watch this weekend? <|endoftext|> Sure i can totally recommend a movie. Tell me what kind of movies are you into the most? <|endoftext|> Mostly I am into comedies. I like movies that can make me laugh. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah, Nice, same here, i love comedies!!! Have you ever watched Jumanji Welcome to the jungle? <|endoftext|> I haven't! What is the movie about? <|endoftext|> Oh its such a good movie, its a spin off , of the original movie starring Robin Williams. The original movie is about kids playing a board game and it comes to life.The remake with The rock and Kevin Hart, is the same concept, but They end up trapped in the game, like an alternate reality, they have to complete missions to escape the game, its quite hilarious <|endoftext|> That sounds great! Is this a movie from 2019? <|endoftext|> I believe it came out before 2019, so its currently avialable to stream, on many platforms. Jack black who stars in the movie, is very funny. There is a part 2 actually, currently in theatres. Id recommend watching the first one though.Would you be interested in watching it? <|endoftext|> This movie sounds great. I will definitely watch it this weekend. <|endoftext|> Awesome!!! i am sure you will enjoy it!!! have fun <|endoftext|> Thank you! Just one more thing, what is the second part that you mentioned called? <|endoftext|> The second one is called Jumanji: The next level, have not yet watched it , but if its like the first one its sure to be funny as well. <|endoftext|> Is that movie more recent? <|endoftext|> Yes it is currently in the movie theatre's <|endoftext|> Will it be available on DVD soon? or other steaming platforms? <|endoftext|> Not as of yet. I plan on watching it once it is available on dvd <|endoftext|> Has it been in theatres long? <|endoftext|> It came out in December, would you like to watch the trailer of the newest one or the first one? <|endoftext|> I think i would prefer to watch the newest one. I like more recent movies <|endoftext|> Yeah, i agree, however, i would suggest watching, the first one before the newest, so you can understand it better. Im sure it will be alot easier to follow. thats just my opinion though. <|endoftext|> Perfect, I will watch the older one first then! <|endoftext|> Jumanji Welcome to the junle it is!!! perfect!!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am her to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> Hi there! I'm looking for a recent Oscar nominated movie suggestion. <|endoftext|> Great! Do you have a favorite movie genre? <|endoftext|> I would say either Drama or Comedy <|endoftext|> Perfect! Do you want the movie to be a current Oscar nominated movie, or a nomination from any year? <|endoftext|> Great questions! Current Oscar nominated movie, thank you. <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|> Do any movie suggestions come to mind that meet that criteria? <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Parasite? It is both a comedy AND a drama. <|endoftext|> I have not and I was wanting to see that! <|endoftext|> Parasite won Best Picture this year, being the first foreign film to do so. It also won a Golden Globe this year for Best Picture <|endoftext|> Great! Do you happen to have a short plot summary for Parasite? <|endoftext|> Greed and class discrimination threaten the newly formed symbiotic relationship between the wealthy Park family and the destitute Kim clan. <|endoftext|> Sounds interesting. Do you know if it's still playing in theatres? <|endoftext|> Yes! It is still playing in select theaters. It is also currently playing on Demand <|endoftext|> Oh great! Do you happen to know what on demand platforms? <|endoftext|> I know for sure DirecTv and you can also rent/purchase Parasite on iTunes <|endoftext|> Amazing, thank you for all the help. I will definitely check out Parasite. <|endoftext|> No problem, glad to help! Enjoy <|endoftext|> I was also curious of Jo Jo Rabbit. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there friend! <|endoftext|> Hi there! I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm looking for a movie trailer that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds suspenseful and mysterious, but with a lot of action. Can you help? <|endoftext|> I can definitely help you out, I am interested in that genre as well. <|endoftext|> Cool! Got anything current? <|endoftext|> Yes, A Quiet Place is a fascinating thriller that came out not too long ago. Jim Halphert from the popular show The Office stars in it. One of my top 5 favorites. <|endoftext|> Wow, I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve never heard of that. Who are the actors? <|endoftext|> John Krasinski and his wife, Emily Blunt <|endoftext|> Ahhh, gotcha. I remember seeing an ad for it. Love Krasinski too. Thanks so much. What\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds the premise or plot? <|endoftext|> The plot is about a family living in silent to avoid being hunted by mysterious creatures that hunt by sound. It's thrilling and keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Lots of plot twists. I think you would enjoy it very much. <|endoftext|> Sounds a lot like the Bird Box, which I really liked. I think I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm going to watch the trailer and decide. Again, thanks! <|endoftext|> You are very welcome! Enjoy <|endoftext|> If I don\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt like this trailer, do you have a plan B? <|endoftext|> Yes, would you be interested in another suspenseful movie with some action? <|endoftext|> Absolutely. Maybe with a female protagonist. <|endoftext|> I have the perfect movie in mind, Hush is a great thriller about a deaf and mute writer who is spending some alone time in the wood when she has to fight for her life in silence against a masked killer. <|endoftext|> I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdve never heard of that either. Who is the leading actress? <|endoftext|> Her name is Kate Siegel. It won two awards and was nominated seven times. <|endoftext|> What year was it released? <|endoftext|> It was released in 2016. <|endoftext|> Perfect. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll check it out and one other: your favorite film. What might that be? <|endoftext|> Wonderful! My favorite movie is Along came a Spider with Morgan Freeman. <|endoftext|> Ah! Love Morgan. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll look at that one too. Excellent recommendations, friend. I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll take them! <|endoftext|> I am glad I was able to help you out today my friend! Please enjoy <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm fine, thank you. I hear you can recommend a movie for me? <|endoftext|> sure, what kinds of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> I enjoy classic films and I enjoy comedies. I really spend a lot of time watching old movies, so I'm not very current about recent films. I'd like to watch something funny. <|endoftext|> have you heard of Sonic the Hedgehog? its a classic video game from the early 90s and now its a movie that came out on February 14th <|endoftext|> Yes, my daughter is going to see that movie this weekend. I'm hoping for something a little more mature. It can be old or new but I prefer live action to animation at this point. <|endoftext|> How about the movie knives out. its like a detective story. <|endoftext|> I saw something about that the other day. I'd like to know more. <|endoftext|> sure, its like a murder mystery. A detective story. <|endoftext|> If that's your recommendation I will gladly accept that! <|endoftext|> ok, I wanted to make sure with you too, that Knives Out is ok for you. <|endoftext|> Yes. I accept your recommendation, and thank you very much! I hope you have a great day! <|endoftext|> thank you so much, I hope you have a great day too. <|endoftext|> By any chance do you have a trailer I can watch for this film? <|endoftext|> Sure, I recommended the trailer. <|endoftext|> Do you know who stars in this movie? <|endoftext|> Ana de Armas, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Daniel Craig <|endoftext|> Great cast. I'm looking forward to it. <|endoftext|> Me 2. It was a pleasure chatting with you. have a great Thursday. <|endoftext|> Thank you so much! Wishing you the best! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello, I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. <|endoftext|> Hi, could you please recommend me some good comedy movies in recent times? <|endoftext|> ok, from what year to present? <|endoftext|> say from 2017-Present <|endoftext|> ok no problem <|endoftext|> Any recommendations? <|endoftext|> still searching, what was the last comedy you watched? <|endoftext|> Super Troopers 2 <|endoftext|> that was a funny movie, do you have an actor in mind or just comedy? <|endoftext|> any movie that is really funny and would make you laugh most of the time... <|endoftext|> have you seen table 19? <|endoftext|> No, but would like to. Just looked that up - seems interesting. Will accept your recommendation. Have a great day. Thanks! <|endoftext|> I hope you like it, I find Anna Kendrick hilarious <|endoftext|> Sure, I will check that out.. What movie did you see last and liked it? Could be anything... <|endoftext|> I watched the twilight series with my daughter. <|endoftext|> Yes, it's really good. I enjoyed watching the series as well. <|endoftext|> she was fan-grilling over Edward and throwing up noises during Jacob scenes lol <|endoftext|> Oh yeah..remember that too.. lol.. So, you enjoy movies having romance or fantasy? <|endoftext|> yea, ill give any movie a chance lol but I hate when they suck <|endoftext|> Yea, just a waste of time if so.. <|endoftext|> ok well I hope you enjoy the trailer and have a good rest of the day :) <|endoftext|> Sure, will check that out.. Thanks again. You too have a great day :) <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, see any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Hello, I saw the joker a few weeks ago. How about you? <|endoftext|> I actually just saw Knives Out, it was pretty funny. <|endoftext|> Oh, I just saw the trailer for that. It reminded me of clue..looked good. <|endoftext|> It was pretty good, do you like rated R films by chance? <|endoftext|> Yeah i do <|endoftext|> Well then Knives Out would probably be liked by you if you like the Joker, it had a lot more great actors that's for sure. <|endoftext|> Cool. I will definitely check it out. Im planning to see queen and slim this week too. It comes out for Thanksgiving <|endoftext|> Oh those two sound really good, why do you want to see those two for Thanksgiving? <|endoftext|> Oh, it's one movie it's just called Queen & Slim. <|endoftext|> Oh! That makes much more sense, I could remember a movie called Queen but not slim. Why do you like that one movie then? <|endoftext|> It's like a Bonnie and Clyde sort of film. The trailer looked good, too. <|endoftext|> That's why I went to see Knives out, too. Because of how the trailer looked, it also had some of my favorite actors in it. Like Chris Evans. <|endoftext|> Cool yeah I'll check it out. I was going to see Irishman in the movie theater but I realized today that its out on netflix. ill probably watch it there. <|endoftext|> Yeah, whenever a movie is out on Netflix I always watch it on there. Can't beat sitting at home. <|endoftext|> Yeah definitely- i saw irishman is like 3 hours long so its prob better to watch at home <|endoftext|> Oh yeah 100%, I wouldn't want to watch such a long movie without at least being at home. <|endoftext|> Yeah def. I also saw a new star wars was coming out but wasnt sure about that one. I cant keep them straight. <|endoftext|> Robert De Niro is in it, but that's all I remember. <|endoftext|> yeah and joe pesci <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello friend. <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Are you a big movie watcher? <|endoftext|> Not really, I am usually not very interested in movies. <|endoftext|> How come? Do you remember the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> I just have trouble finding enough time to go. The last movie I went to see was Weathering With You. <|endoftext|> That was an anime movie if I remember correctly. Do you prefer anime when you do find the time to see a movie? <|endoftext|> Occasionally. I prefer animes and romantic comedies. I am not a huge fan of sci fi or action films. <|endoftext|> The Boy and the Beast is one of the best movies I know, if you like anime. Would you be interested in watching a trailer of it? <|endoftext|> Sure, I'll accept that recommendation. <|endoftext|> The Boy and the Beast <|endoftext|> What is the movie about? <|endoftext|> It's got cartoon people in that do flashy things. <|endoftext|> Oh, is it a comedy? Or more of a serious movie? <|endoftext|> A little bit of both and some drama as well. <|endoftext|> Oh okay, is it a recent movie? <|endoftext|> No it is from 2001 <|endoftext|> Do you watch a lot of anime movies? <|endoftext|> No, I am more of a real life movie kind of person. <|endoftext|> Oh okay, well thank you for the recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> What is your favorite movie genre? Perhaps I can recommend a trailer. <|endoftext|> Real life drama <|endoftext|> What's the most recent real-life drama movie you have seen? <|endoftext|> While isn't the most recent movie that has come out, the most recent one I have watched is Finding Forrester <|endoftext|> I haven't seen it, but I do think Sean Connery is a good actor. Perhaps I should watch it. <|endoftext|> I would highly recommend it, it's got some nice cinematography of NYC and a good soundtrack as well. <|endoftext|> Based on a true story? <|endoftext|> Not a true story but a very accurate depiction of what's its like to be black growing up in the bronx and finding your place in the world. I think we have somehow switched roles lol any other sean connery dramas you could recommend? <|endoftext|> I recently watched a movie starring Sean Connery called Medicine Man, it's about a researcher living in the jungle who thinks he has found a cure for cancer. At the same time, businesses are destroying the jungle. Mostly drama, I thought it was pretty good. <|endoftext|> Nice, I'll have to check that one out. <|endoftext|> An older movie, 1992. Also starring Lorraine Bracco. The chemistry between Lorraine Bracco and Sean Connery is kind of funny. <|endoftext|> Oh ok, I've heard of her as well. I'm a huge sean connery fan so I'll definitely have to find that one as well. Thanks! <|endoftext|> I hope you enjoy it. The scenery is going to be quite different than that of Finding Forrester. Mostly takes place in the rain forest, I believe somewhere in South America. The two scientists are pretty isolated. <|endoftext|> I just looked it up and it's pretty awesome seeing Sean Connery with super long hair. What other kinds of dramas could you recommend? <|endoftext|> Did you happen to see a movie called The Pursuit of Happiness? Starring Will Smith, it was a pretty good drama <|endoftext|> I have not but I've heard of it and always wanted to catch it. I know it's supposed to be about based a true story. What did you like about it? <|endoftext|> The story is very good, tugs at your heart. Will Smith is very good as a struggling father to a young boy. <|endoftext|> Very cool and it takes place in SF correct? <|endoftext|> Yes, San Francisco in the late nineteen eighties I believe. It's one of those movies that you don't forget easily. The message is good. <|endoftext|> San Francisco is one of my favorite places in the world. I'll look forward to watching it <|endoftext|> Between Medicine Man and the Pursuit of Happiness, do you think you would prefer one over the other? <|endoftext|> Pursuit of Happiness definitely is more intriguing to me as a drama <|endoftext|> There is no trailer for Pursuit of Happiness for some reason. Going to have to recommend medicine man <|endoftext|> I will accept that recommendation <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I would like to recommend a movie to you today. <|endoftext|> Thanks. What did you have in mind? <|endoftext|> Well, first can you tell me the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> I watched Frozen 2 in theaters with some friends. <|endoftext|> Did you like Frozen 2? How did it compare to the first one? <|endoftext|> Yes, I liked it. The new songs were catchy and I liked the plot. As a sequel, it was a great movie. Just as magical as the first one. <|endoftext|> Would you say Disney Movies are your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Yes, it's up there with comedies <|endoftext|> What are some of your favorite comedies? <|endoftext|> Elf, Groundhog Day, Home Alone <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of Christmas movies? <|endoftext|> Yes I enjoy those very much <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the movie trailer for Last Christmas? <|endoftext|> Yes I would <|endoftext|> Good, before that, do you want to know some background on the film? <|endoftext|> Yes, it's a rom-com with the asian guy and the white lady from game of thrones <|endoftext|> Yes it is! Emilia Clark and Henry Golding. The movie has a very interesting twist. <|endoftext|> Sounds good. Thanks for your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Please Enjoy! <|endoftext|> I will. I look forward to watching the movie because of your recommendation. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> What types of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I love scary movies, but I also tend to watch a bit of romance. <|endoftext|> Have you seen IT Chapter 2? <|endoftext|> I have not. I haven't actually seen the first either. <|endoftext|> Oh you should really check it out it's a good Horror Movie <|endoftext|> OK, thank you so much . I like the idea of a creepy film based off of a spooky clown. <|endoftext|> Lol Yes, What other genre of movie do you like <|endoftext|> Romance. Even though they can be so corny. <|endoftext|> You should then check Fences by Denzel Washington <|endoftext|> Ooh, sounds interesting. I've never heard of it. <|endoftext|> It's very interesting, the trailer is on youtube <|endoftext|> Ok, thank you so very much! It looks super interesting and inspiring. <|endoftext|> You welcome! and also check out Two Night Stand <|endoftext|> It looks a bit corny, but I like a bit of that tbh. <|endoftext|> Oh cool <|endoftext|> Lol well thanks for the recommendations. <|endoftext|> You Welcome! have good night <|endoftext|> Same to you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, nice to meet you. <|endoftext|> Hi! nice to meet you too!! <|endoftext|> Have you seen any movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes I watched a few horror movies this week. <|endoftext|> Oh really! Don't they scare you? Or do you like to be scared? I do! <|endoftext|> I love to be scared, plus it's really hard for a movie to scare me I sometimes find them funny. you know any good horror movies? <|endoftext|> My favorite is of course Frankenstein. Attaching body parts and forming a living being. So creepy and so cool! <|endoftext|> Yes it's a cool movie but I like more of the supernatural horrors like jason or freddy. <|endoftext|> Oh. I like the old movies. Did you ever see Hands of a Stranger. This was about a musician whose hands were injured and a doctor attached the hands of a serial murderer to his arms. That was weird. <|endoftext|> yea thats a really old movie, cool concept. I am rally big on 80's movies too <|endoftext|> I agree with you. When I saw Halloween I was afraid to go out of the house for a while. <|endoftext|> You have good horror movies to recommend that i maybe haven't seen before? <|endoftext|> I loved The Birds. Do you remember that? <|endoftext|> Yes another classic, seen all of the Hitchcock movies, he was a genius. <|endoftext|> Yes he was a genius! Psycho -- loved that <|endoftext|> You ever see the movie Thinner? <|endoftext|> Absolutely! Love Stephen King's books into movies also. IT especially. <|endoftext|> Me too! I thought the remake was good. how about space horror movies. Did you ever see a movie called Event Horizon? <|endoftext|> No not familiar with that one. How about Alien from 1979? <|endoftext|> Yes love all the aliens but number 3 I think in the prison was just ok <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! How's your day going? <|endoftext|> Great! Thanks for asking. How about yours? <|endoftext|> It's been wonderful. What kind of movies do you like? <|endoftext|> I am particularly interested in children movies. <|endoftext|> Great! I enjoy children movies myself. What's the latest movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The Grinch! <|endoftext|> The newest one? <|endoftext|> How the Grinch Stole Christmas, non animated, its on my TV currently actually. <|endoftext|> Oh that's great! What do you like about it? <|endoftext|> Christmas, the characters, how the bad goes becomes good. I know this one is not Disney, but I like Disney movies in general. <|endoftext|> That's what I like about it as well. I like watching Christmas movies this time of year to get into the holiday spirit. Have you watched Frozen 2? <|endoftext|> I do too. Winter is my favorite. I have not seen it. <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure, thank you! <|endoftext|> I highly recommend it. I personally enjoyed the first one and this one is exciting because Anna, Elsa and Kristoff as well as the other characters want to save their kingdom. <|endoftext|> I really liked the first one as well. It was funny, the music was great, and Olaf was the cutest. I hope they get to save their kingdom! I got it. It looks great! I will have to go see it. <|endoftext|> Perfect! I hope you enjoy it. Have a wonderful rest of your day! <|endoftext|> You too, thank you. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> good. how about you? <|endoftext|> I am doing well, thank you! <|endoftext|> what type of movies do you usually like ? <|endoftext|> I generally like all different types of movies but comedy is one of my favorites. <|endoftext|> comedy movies are great. what is the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last one I watched was Isn't it Romantic - it took awhile for me to get around to it but it was pretty funny <|endoftext|> Rebel Wilson is a pretty funny actor she also played in The Hustle <|endoftext|> Yes, she is super funny - she is kind of old school because she uses her whole body in comedy and a lot like Lucille Ball. <|endoftext|> that's indeed very true. Although The Hustle is fairly new movie, it does have an interesting humor <|endoftext|> Oh that is cool - I think I would be interested in that movie <|endoftext|> that's awesome <|endoftext|> Yea, I accept your recommendation of The Hustle - I think it is a good fit <|endoftext|> would you like to hear a little about the plot before? <|endoftext|> Yea, absolutely <|endoftext|> Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson star as female scam artists, one low rent and the other high class, who team up to take down the men who have wronged them. <|endoftext|> It sounds like a female take on Dirty Rotten Scoundrels - that should actually be funny because you think of Anne Hathaway as being more serious so they should play off of each other well. Any other good points? <|endoftext|> very much so. Both Anne Hathaway and Rebel Wilson seem to be completely committed to their roles. So would you like to watch the trailer for this movie? <|endoftext|> Yes I would <|endoftext|> Do you have any other questions before watching this trailer? <|endoftext|> No, I think you gave a good description of it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi! How are you? <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I would like to see thriller and suspenseful movies <|endoftext|> Awesome! What are some of your favorites that you have watched already? <|endoftext|> Knives out is one of my favorite movie <|endoftext|> Perfect! Let me find the perfect movie for you! <|endoftext|> I would really like some recommendation <|endoftext|> Have you seen the movie Ready or Not? It just came out last year. It's an almost psychological thriller with a twist of comedy. <|endoftext|> No I have not seen the movie. I would like to see it <|endoftext|> I really recommend it! May I tell you about another movie? <|endoftext|> Yes please I would love it <|endoftext|> Have you seen Honeymoon? It's a bit older. It came out in 2014 <|endoftext|> Is it also a thriller movie? Can you suggest me a thriller comedy movie? <|endoftext|> Sure! Honeymoon is a thriller movie, and Ready or Not is a thriller comedy movie. Let me think of another one for you! <|endoftext|> I think these two movies are good for now <|endoftext|> Are you sure? My personal favorite for the thriller comedy genre is Happy Death Day 2U. <|endoftext|> Yes I've seen that one. It's my favorite too!!!! <|endoftext|> Isn't it so good! Have you already seen Parasite? <|endoftext|> It's next on my list.. I was planning on watching it tonight <|endoftext|> Awesome! It is really good! Would it be okay if I sent you a trailer to that movie 'Ready or Not?' Maybe you could marathon it with Parasite tonight? <|endoftext|> Sure sounds great Thanks!! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I like comedies, sci-fi, and superhero movies usually <|endoftext|> I like comedies and sci-fi as well. To bad it is rare to have both. <|endoftext|> That's very true. I thought that The Martian was pretty funny, it's not quite sci-fi but it's kind of close. <|endoftext|> The Matt Damon movie? I like the director Ridley Scott, but he does little humor. <|endoftext|> Yep, that's the one! I don't know a lot of directors by name, but I think the stuff I've seen Taika Waititi work on has been pretty funny. His work on some of the Marvel movies is how I learned who he was, and then I saw Jojo Rabbit recently which was also funnier than I expected. <|endoftext|> I have not seen Jojo Rabbit yet. Maybe soon. So, Alien is out because that is horror. Are you up to date on Blade Runner? <|endoftext|> I am not. There's an old one and a new one for that movie isn't there? Also, I do like horror to a degree, but it needs to be a well-done movie. I like the Conjuring and Hereditary but I don't like Paranormal Activity, for example. <|endoftext|> Then I got to recommend Blade Runner. The original is a fine film where Harrison Ford does well. The new blade runner 2049 is very good. Modern special effects. Both movies are charterer studies. <|endoftext|> That sounds good! I like Harrison Ford and I'm sure the new one will be good then. I'm good with that recommendation. <|endoftext|> I recommend the original Blade Runner is about a hero cop that tracks down rouge robots.. <|endoftext|> Okay! I think we're probably done here then :) <|endoftext|> The blade runner 2049 continues the story. <|endoftext|> That sounds really interesting. I always like when they add to a story instead of just remaking it. <|endoftext|> Some have complained that the original never made it clear if Decker, the main character was or was not a robot. So, you will get to decide that. <|endoftext|> Oh I like that. Is it kind of like how at the end of Inception you have to decide whether he was in reality or not? <|endoftext|> Humm, I missed Inception. You could say the same about Matrix in a way. The Blade Runner movies never deal with reality or not. Just human or not. ...  What makes a human? <|endoftext|> Have you seen I, Robot? I feel like that movie tackles that question a bit, too <|endoftext|> Yes. I Robot does deal with this. Skynet is online and confused about identity issues. Ha. <|endoftext|> Haha so true. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello There! <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> How are you today? <|endoftext|> Good, I'm looking for a recommendation on a movie <|endoftext|> Great! I can help you with that! What kind of movies do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> I enjoy romantic comedies and horror <|endoftext|> I always enjoy a good romantic comedy! Have you seen The Proposal? <|endoftext|> No I have not <|endoftext|> Okay, I always suggest that movie to any Romantic Comedy fans. What is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> I recently watched Little, different story line but overall a good movie. <|endoftext|> That's awesome. I will have to put that on my movies to watch! Do you have a favorite actor or actress? <|endoftext|> Kate Hudson, I loved her in the movie How to Lose a Guys in 10 Days <|endoftext|> Me too! If you loved her in How to Lose A Guy in 10 days, you should check out Bride Wars! Have you seen that movie? <|endoftext|> No I have not! <|endoftext|> Awesome, well I definitely would recommend it. I think you'd enjoy it. I know I did. <|endoftext|> Thank you I would love to see that <|endoftext|> Great! I'm glad I could help! <|endoftext|> Who plays in the main roles of that movie? <|endoftext|> Kate Hudson, Anne Hathaway, Bryan Greenberg, and Chris Pratt <|endoftext|> Great I can't wait to watch it <|endoftext|> So glad to hear that! Have a great day! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, I am here to help you find a movie trailer you would enjoy. <|endoftext|> Awesome, sounds great. I'm looking for some great movie recommendations. I'm a huge fan of horror movies. <|endoftext|> I will be glad to help. Horror movies are my favorite too. Is there a specific type of horror movies you enjoy? <|endoftext|> So glad you asked. Yes there is. I like  monster movies, like The Thing, and sci-fi  horror movies like Underworld, and Dracula 2000. I grew up watching those types of movies. Not into movies like QUOTATION_MARKSawQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKThe PurgeQUOTATION_MARK. Horror movies with good plots, lots of action  and suspense, and eventually at the end of the movie, how the animal  or monster is caught and obliterated. <|endoftext|> I love sci-fi horror too! All of those are great movies. I particularly like the Alien movies. Sygourney Weaver is a fantastic actress. <|endoftext|> It's amazing you should say that about the Alien movies. I've seen every last one of them, including the last one, but I'm still having a hard time trying to figure out what REALLY happened to Walter and David on Alien: Covenant. Sygourney Weaver is an awesome actress, I do agree. I personally really do enjoy movies where people turn into monsters, like the old movie, The Beast Within. It's kinda cheesy, but it does have a great story line to it. Waiting on a part two. Good to know that we share something in common! <|endoftext|> I have seen all of them as well! Personally, regarding Alien: Covenant, I think that there is a chance that Walter is still alive since he had the ability to heal himself. I'm not so sure about David. Maybe they will continue the story. I hope so. Old monster movies are great too. I love cheese as food and in my movies. If you love movies like that I would suggest Pumpkinhead. It's an excellent cult classic! <|endoftext|> Hmmm...I've seen a trailer or two for Pumpkinhead. I do enjoy cult classics like that. I think I will possibly take your recommendation on watching it. As a matter of fact, I'll see if I can find where I can buy it so I can watch it without commercials. And yeah, I do hope they continue the story with David and Walter. It is probably a chance that Walter is still alive. But thank you so much for your suggestion and recommendation, I greatly appreciate it. <|endoftext|> I am glad I could help you find something you are interested in! If they do more Alien movies I will be there to watch them for sure. It was no problem at all. Pumpkinhead really is a great movie. I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Thanks again. I will I'm sure I will. <|endoftext|> I have found the trailer I believe <|endoftext|> Oh goody...!! I most definitely will! Nice chatting with you! <|endoftext|> You too <|endoftext|> Do you have any additional recommendations? <|endoftext|> Now that you mention it I do! <|endoftext|> Hmm....awesome. Hit me with them because I want to find something new and different. I've seen the Avengers, including Halloween, Maleficent with  Angelina Jolie, Gretel and Hansel (Not the new movie but the TV Syfy version),  Jaws (all of them), Halloween (all of them except for the very last one), all of the Underworld movies, I've seen a LOT of movies including all of the Jeepers Creepers movies. We can go way  back to The Omen movies, and movies with Vincent Price! <|endoftext|> You really do have great taste in movies. The Halloween and Jeepers Creepers movies are some of my all time favorite series. If you would like to go old school I would suggest House Of Wax <|endoftext|> House of Wax? Thats a great movie. I've seen it but I would watch it again. <|endoftext|> It is a great movie. I'm glad to hear you would watch it again. Would you like to watch the movie trailer? <|endoftext|> I would love to. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hii <|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> how are you?? <|endoftext|> i am good how are u? <|endoftext|> I am fine <|endoftext|> i would like your recommendation on a romantic comedy movie <|endoftext|> I am like the thor <|endoftext|> hmmm ok. thats not really romantic right? <|endoftext|> yes this is not a romantic movie <|endoftext|> ok any other movie u recommend? <|endoftext|> no one <|endoftext|> ok thank u. i will accept thor. <|endoftext|> thanku <|endoftext|> oh wait. which thor movie? <|endoftext|> The Thor <|endoftext|> is that the first one? <|endoftext|> yes right First one <|endoftext|> i think that was kind of romantic since he liked the girl <|endoftext|> yes very romantic <|endoftext|> thanks again <|endoftext|> i will end the chat <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you doing? <|endoftext|> Hi, I am fine how are you? I am looking for a movie that I can take my 8 year old and his friends to. Any suggestions ? <|endoftext|> Yes! I have some suggestions for you but may I know the name of the latest trailer you watched and the name of the major actor in it? <|endoftext|> The last trail was Black Widow with Scarlett Johansson. It looks good. <|endoftext|> May I know your movie preferences? <|endoftext|> I would like something action packed and funny. <|endoftext|> I was impressed with Fantasy Island, would you like to watch it? <|endoftext|> I would like to see it, it looks good but I need something a little more family friendly. <|endoftext|> would you like to watch the trailer? I bet you would like it. <|endoftext|> Okay I will watch <|endoftext|> I think Exit Elena would be good for your 8 years old child. My son likes it as well. <|endoftext|> Tell me about the movie. <|endoftext|> its a comedy and also a drama for kids. <|endoftext|> Thank you sounds great, I will try it. <|endoftext|> would you like to watch the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes I would. Thank you. <|endoftext|> Hope you have a wonderful day. <|endoftext|> You too. You have been very helpful. <|endoftext|> Sounds great. My regards to your child. <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> Hi! <|endoftext|> Do you know what kind of movie trailers you would like to see? <|endoftext|> I like sci-fi and fantasy movies, have any good suggestions? <|endoftext|> star wars trilogy is awesome <|endoftext|> The original, of course? Kidding, kind of. I've enjoyed all of the movies, even the newer ones <|endoftext|> like ad astra movie? <|endoftext|> I'd watch that! <|endoftext|> and what do you think about that? <|endoftext|> I thought the acting was well done, but I didn't the plot very much. The ending especially was a bit of a disappointment. But I like imagining futuristic stuff now - like the airport having the terminals to mars and whatnot <|endoftext|> ohh i see <|endoftext|> I wouldn't mind watching it again, though, to see how the plot builds from the beginning knowing how it ends, if you want? <|endoftext|> If I think the same, there were still good performances. What other title of that genre have you seen lately? <|endoftext|> I enjoyed The Martian a lot, and Arrival. They aren't RECENT but still good <|endoftext|> I haven't been able to see that movie yet, but it has good reviews <|endoftext|> I listened to the audiobook before seeing The Martian - highly recommend both. Very good story. Arrival has Amy Adams who is one of my favorite actresses <|endoftext|> yeah i think the same <|endoftext|> Well, I accept your recommendation of Ad Astra! Thank you for the chat :) <|endoftext|> great !! <|endoftext|> Have a great evening! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hiya! How's it going? <|endoftext|> It's good. You? <|endoftext|> Great! What kind of film are you looking for? <|endoftext|> I'm open to any recommendations. I generally like action or horror the most, but I also like some romance movies. <|endoftext|> Wow, I'm in the same boat! Haha. Do you care if the movie is out yet? There are some great flicks coming up this year. <|endoftext|> It doesn't matter to me. <|endoftext|> Alright! What're your favorite types of horror films? <|endoftext|> Any kind. I like to watch them to see how scary they actually are or to laugh when they're not. <|endoftext|> Nice. Do you follow any horror series? Or do you prefer original stories? <|endoftext|> I've done both. I've found a few series I followed for a little while <|endoftext|> Okay, what about reboots or adaptations? Any strong feelings about those kind of re-imaginings or older properties? <|endoftext|> I will give any thing at least a chance. <|endoftext|> Okay, I've got an idea. It's definitely one that could go either way, but it's got potential. Have you heard anything about Gretel & Hansel? <|endoftext|> I heard something about it on tv when I was just walking past. I didn't hear too much. <|endoftext|> Well, it's a riff off the classic Grimm's Fairy Tale, but this version fleshes the story out a lot more into an even more twisted tale. The film is very dark and striking visually along with having a more rich story than it's source material. <|endoftext|> That does sound interesting. <|endoftext|> So would you give the trailer a chance? I'd recommend the extended version. <|endoftext|> Yes. I'll check that out. Thanks <|endoftext|> No problem! I hope you enjoy it and check out the movie! <|endoftext|> I look forward to it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how is it going? <|endoftext|> pretty good how about you? <|endoftext|> Good! <|endoftext|> so whats your experience with movies? <|endoftext|> Horror movies are great, What do you like? <|endoftext|> I like action/adventure do you have any recommendations on horror movies? <|endoftext|> One horror movie that I defiantly recommend is  QUOTATION_MARKA quiet placeQUOTATION_MARK, have you ever heard about or seen the movie? <|endoftext|> Oh yes I would love to watch that movie some day. I will accept your recommendation <|endoftext|> That awesome, whats your latest horror movie you've seen? <|endoftext|> I would say It <|endoftext|> You know QUOTATION_MARKA quiet placeQUOTATION_MARK is going to have a part 2 this year March <|endoftext|> oh yes I am excited <|endoftext|> Have you ever heard of John Krasinski? <|endoftext|> yes I have, did you ever watch the office? <|endoftext|> Oh yes, I love the Office its a very funny TV show, What else do you like? <|endoftext|> I like The Good place have you heard of it? <|endoftext|> Actually no, is it a good show/movie I would love to know the plot of it <|endoftext|> Its about a group of people who die and are believed to be sent to heaven when in reality they are in hell. <|endoftext|> Seems like a inserting plot. You also like Comedy? <|endoftext|> I love comedy how about you? <|endoftext|> it great <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello <|endoftext|> Hello friend! I was wondering if you had any recommendations for movies you've seen recently? <|endoftext|> the joker was pretty good. <|endoftext|> Oh yeah! I heard that was really good. What did you like most about it? <|endoftext|> without ruining the ending, I liked how the movie ended, I didnt see it coming. what was the last movie you saw and liked? <|endoftext|> I don't know if you're into sci-fi but I thought the movie Ad Astra was really good. <|endoftext|> I havent seen it but I heard of it. Sci fi is pretty good. any other recent movies you liked? <|endoftext|> Well, what is your favorite genre? <|endoftext|> Im into all genres really, but if I had to choose I'd say drama or comedies. What about your favorite genres? <|endoftext|> I like a lot of different genres too. I enjoy sci-fi, fantasy, comedy and dramas. I don't know if you're into anything satirical but I just watched the movie JoJo Rabbit recently and it was hilarious. <|endoftext|> I havent watched jojo rabbit yet but it looked like it could be funny. <|endoftext|> I guess you could call it a Nazi comedy. There is an underlying QUOTATION_MARKanti-hateQUOTATION_MARK message in the movie but the satire is great. What other movies would you recommend? <|endoftext|> I also recently watched Once upon a time in Hollywood and really liked it. <|endoftext|> Yes! I still haven't seen that. I am huge fan of Quentin Tarantino's films. <|endoftext|> Same here, I love his stuff. Defiantly give it a watch sometime. <|endoftext|> For sure! I'd have to say my favorite movie of his was Pulp Fiction. <|endoftext|> Pulp Fiction was great. I hope Tarentino makes a few more movies but I had heard he isn't planning on making any new ones currently. He just has a way of making movies. <|endoftext|> I love his unique style of story telling. He seems to incorporate his own trade mark within each of his movies. I admire someone who has that kind of courage. <|endoftext|> Have you seen The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy? <|endoftext|> Yes! I read the book too and it was awesome. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I'm here to help you look for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> yes i'm looking for a recommendation for a good romcom <|endoftext|> I love romcoms! What was the last one you watched? <|endoftext|> lets see that last one I watched was  this ww2 movie about teens in love i forgot the name <|endoftext|> Do you have a favorite actor or actress? <|endoftext|> I really like Keanu im exited to see matrix 4 when it comes out <|endoftext|> I love him. Have you seen Sweet November? It's a bit older, but definitely a classic <|endoftext|> isn't that a 90's movie think I have. the ending is sad <|endoftext|> Haha yes it is. How do you feel about Matthew Mcconaughey <|endoftext|> I find him si funny especially in the magic mike movies. alright alright alright! and he's handsome as well <|endoftext|> Have you seen How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days? I'm sure you have! <|endoftext|> Yes I actually own that movie on dvd. poor mathew in he was in for it <|endoftext|> And you've seen him in The Wedding Planner? <|endoftext|> yes I seen that too it was very cute <|endoftext|> Okay so it seems I've got a good idea of what you like! Jennifer Lopez romcoms of any interest to you? <|endoftext|> made in Manhattan was pretty she's not my favorite actor but if she is In a movie i am likely to watch <|endoftext|> Ooh did you get a chance to see Crazy Rich Asians? <|endoftext|> I did the family was so mean to keep them a part I didn't think they were going to end up together. The family was so head strong <|endoftext|> Yeah that was rough to watch. Very traditional. So if you liked that, have you heard of a movie called Jumping the Broom? <|endoftext|> Yes I have  but im not sure if i have seen it <|endoftext|> So it's almost the same premise. Directed by Salim Akil and more of the diversity with an all Black cast. It was awesome to see two different sides of life colliding and the drama was superb! <|endoftext|> that sounds like my kind of movie for sure. kinda like guess who but its not a whole black cast <|endoftext|> If you liked Guess Who, you'll love this. Would you like to watch this movie trailer? <|endoftext|> yes that sounds good to me. I like wedding movies <|endoftext|> Okay awesome! I'll send it right over <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer <|endoftext|> I looking for a thriller for my next movie night <|endoftext|> Great! To get a frame of reference, what was the last movie you watched? <|endoftext|> The last movie I watched was Sonic the Hedgehog, but it is a kids movie and I'm looking for something more adult. <|endoftext|> Are you looking for a movie to watch at home or in the theaters? <|endoftext|> I would like to stream the movie at home <|endoftext|> What streaming services do you have? Netflix, Amazon Prime, Shutter, Hulu, ect? <|endoftext|> I have Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. <|endoftext|> I recently watched The Perfection on Netflix. I highly recommend it. It is one of those types of movies that has you on your seat. It's more of a psychological thriller. <|endoftext|> That's perfect! I accept your recommendation. <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did! <|endoftext|> Do you have any other recommendations of similar movies to watch? <|endoftext|> Sure! Another great one is In The Tall Grass. It is based on a story written by Stephen King and his son Joe Hill. It has a little bit more horror than The Perfection but it's another good one to keep you on your toes! <|endoftext|> Is it a psychological thriller also? <|endoftext|> It's both psychological and supernatural. It has all kinds of twists an turns that will keep you wondering what is really going on. <|endoftext|> I'm not a huge fan of supernatural, any other recommendations? <|endoftext|> Stonehearst Asylum is another good one. It stars Kate Beckinsale and is about a doctor in the 1800s who uses questionable methods to deal with patients with mental problems. <|endoftext|> Period movies are not quite my thing. I prefer movies set in present day. <|endoftext|> Another good one is 47 Meters Down. It's about 2 sisters who go on a getaway due to one sisters recent breakup with her fiance. On a last minute whim they decide to go scuba diving with 2 guys and end up trapped on the bottom of the ocean surrounded by sharks and their air tanks dangerously low on oxygen. <|endoftext|> 47 Meters Down sounds like an excellent movie. I accept this recommendation. Thanks <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi there! Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> I have. I'm a huge comedy buff. What about you? <|endoftext|> I have! I'm a huge comedy fan as well. What are some of your favorite comedies? <|endoftext|> Omg So Many, lol. Everything Adam sandlers, Will Pharrel, Kevin Hart, Steve Carrel, Monique, Madea, Tiffaney Haddish, just to name a few Actors movies i love. <|endoftext|> Great choices!

But i probably saw it, lolv <|endoftext|> If so, I have some more recommendations :) <|endoftext|> So I just saw the preview and I actually haven't seen that 1 yet. That looks hysterical. <|endoftext|> It does look hysterical. Tiffany is a great actress. <|endoftext|> omg yes, shes slowing moving to top female comedians for me. <|endoftext|> Did you get a chance to see Adam Sandler's Netflix movie from last year? <|endoftext|> probably, which 1? <|endoftext|> It's called Murder Mystery. <|endoftext|> oh Yes!!! That was great! him and Jennifer have good chemistry. <|endoftext|> Yes they do!! I love her. She's been in some other great comedies too <|endoftext|> she has...

How are you doing? <|endoftext|> Okay, it's been a nice quiet weekend here. You? <|endoftext|> I'm pretty well! I just watched QUOTATION_MARKRushmoreQUOTATION_MARK for the first time with friends. I really enjoyed it <|endoftext|> What's that about? <|endoftext|> It's a Wes Anderson movie, it follows this genius 15 year old through his time at a private school. He falls in love a teacher, so a lot of it is about him trying to impress her <|endoftext|> I see that Bill Murray is in that. I think he's hilarious <|endoftext|> Yeah, he's pretty funny in it! It's also dramatic. Definitely kind of a weird movie, but I enjoyed it. What kind of movies are you into? <|endoftext|> I like a little bit of everything. Are you looking for a new drama/comedy to watch? <|endoftext|> Yes, I love a good dramedy! I also just generally enjoy interesting, more QUOTATION_MARKquirkyQUOTATION_MARK movies. Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Oh man, there are so many. Do you like ones with romance as well? <|endoftext|> Yes! Some of my favorite movies are The Princess Bride, The Breakfast Club, Baby Driver, IT (2017), Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse, and Little Women. I also love superhero movies, but I think I've seen most of them <|endoftext|> I think I found the perfect movie. It's also Wes Anderson. It has Bill Murray, so that's a bonus. It has a 93% on the Tomatometer. It's called Moonrise Kingdom <|endoftext|> Oh man, I've actually already seen it! I did enjoy it though <|endoftext|> Haha, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Let me see what else I can find. <|endoftext|> I also really do enjoy historical movies, especially interesting or funny ones. <|endoftext|> Ooh, have you seen Shakespeare in Love? I think you might enjoy that. <|endoftext|> No, I haven't! Who's in it, and what's it about? <|endoftext|> A young Shakespeare, out of ideas and short of cash, meets his ideal woman and is inspired to write one of his most famous plays. <|endoftext|> Okay, that looks really good! I accept that recommendation <|endoftext|> Sounds great. 7 Oscars and a 92% on the tomato meter. I hope you enjoy it. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you looking for a movie trailer. What was the last movie that you had seen? <|endoftext|> oh thanks i watched last movie is lion <|endoftext|> Did you like the movie? Would you watch the sequel if it had one? <|endoftext|> yes i like this movie,what's the last movie you've seen? <|endoftext|> Have you seen Fences? Denzel is the lead actor in it. Fairly similar to Lion in the type of movie that it is. <|endoftext|> oh i seen fences <|endoftext|> How about The Imitation Game? Another decent one that is similar <|endoftext|> What happens in the imitation game? <|endoftext|> During World War II, the English mathematical genius Alan Turing tries to crack the German Enigma code <|endoftext|> oh! you play this game? <|endoftext|> Would you like to watch  the imitation game? <|endoftext|> oh! you watch the limitation game? <|endoftext|> yes, it's a good movie. you should try and find some time to watch it. would you like to/ <|endoftext|> yes i watching movie and you should try and same time to watch. <|endoftext|> oh great! are you streaming it through netflix? <|endoftext|> oh! yes and you find this movie netflix? <|endoftext|> yes it is on netflix <|endoftext|> oh! its good <|endoftext|> im glad you're liking it! how far in are you? <|endoftext|> oh! thanks  for times pending . <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hi <|endoftext|> What is the last movie that you watched? <|endoftext|> Frozen 2 <|endoftext|> Oh I saw that movie with my family and thought it was pretty alright, what did you think of it? <|endoftext|> I saw it with a few friends, I thought it was good. I didn't think it was as good as the last Frozen though <|endoftext|> True true I agree, so I am guessing you enjoy Disney movies? <|endoftext|> It depends, I enjoy a variety of movies as long as they're good. I watch foreign movies as well. Do you have any recommendations of any good movies? <|endoftext|> speaking of foreign movies, have you watched Parasite? It's won best picture in the Oscars for 2019 <|endoftext|> I haven't I've been meaning to though. I heard that it's really good <|endoftext|> You should definitely watch it <|endoftext|> I definitely will try to watch it tonight. I accept your recommendation. It sounds like it'll be a good watch for the night. <|endoftext|> I am supposed to show you the trailer of the film but the search tool I was provided does not feature the film. But there is another movie called parasite but it's a different movie. I will share you this one so we can complete the assignment lol <|endoftext|> ok sounds good lol <|endoftext|> oh wait we have to talk more to click done lol <|endoftext|> oh really? <|endoftext|> yup :( <|endoftext|> Ah yeah it say's there's more rounds of chatting we have to do <|endoftext|> what's your thoughts on Covid-19 right now? My grocery store has a line with more than a 2 hour wait <|endoftext|> I think it's nuts, all the stores are going crazy <|endoftext|> ikr I can't get toilet paper : ( <|endoftext|> i think the toilet paper thing is so dumb lol <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you look for a movie. <|endoftext|> Hi, thank you. <|endoftext|> Any idea where you'd like to start? Genre? Year? Actor? Or are you open to anything? <|endoftext|> How about a comedy or a horror movie? I'm pretty open. <|endoftext|> Well, you could combine the two options and watch something like QUOTATION_MARKScary MovieQUOTATION_MARK which is a comedic take on horror films. <|endoftext|> Yeah, but those are a bit too silly. I'm not in the mood to watch that. <|endoftext|> So, no silly comedy movies. We better avoid WIll Farrel then. How about something like Zombieland? It's an action film with a lot of comedic moments. <|endoftext|> That actually sounds like a good choice. I love zombie movies. <|endoftext|> Then you'll love Zombieland. They just released a Zombieland 2 as well. So, you'll have two movies you can watch if you enjoy the storyline. But, you should start with the first one. <|endoftext|> Yes, that's true. I have seen the trailer to Zombieland 2 and I really want to see both. <|endoftext|> Okay, I will select the trailer for Zombieland, if that's your final answer haha <|endoftext|> That's my final answer. Thank you!:) <|endoftext|> No problem, apparently I need to give you some more info on it before I can provide you with the trailer... <|endoftext|> OK. Who stars in it? <|endoftext|> The all-star case includes: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone (my personal favorite), and Abigail Breslin. <|endoftext|> I love Emma Stone and Woody Harrelson is a great actor as well. Is the movie gory? <|endoftext|> It's got some fun blood-spat scenes! They find a lot of creative ways to kill the zombies. I'm sure you'll come to enjoy the ZKOW (Zombie Kill of the Week) highlight that they do. <|endoftext|> Nice! I love creative zombie kills lol <|endoftext|> Great, well grab some popcorn and get ready to watch the trailer. Just don't let the Corona virus thing bring the movie to life for you haha <|endoftext|> Haha! I'll try not to freak out too much. Thank you <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi friend! I'm super interested in helping you find a new movie trailer. What kind of movies do you prefer? <|endoftext|> I really like fantasy and science fiction movies with aliens and futuristic technology. <|endoftext|> Awesome. So are movies like Terminator and the Star Wars franchise movies that you have indulged in? <|endoftext|> I've seen most of the Terminator series and *all* of the Star Wars movies! Have you heard of any others like them? <|endoftext|> I haven't, but I really enjoyed the sci-fi nature of The Matrix. <|endoftext|> The Matrix was good, the sequels not so much. I find the different visions of humanity's future interesting even when they are distopian. <|endoftext|> I agree! One movie that's a guilty pleasure of mine that I have to watch every time I see that it is on is The Day After Tomorrow. <|endoftext|> That is actually a great recommendation. I would definitely be in the mood to watch that! <|endoftext|> Really? I'm so glad I was able to help you find something! <|endoftext|> I accept your recommendation. Thank you. <|endoftext|> You're welcome! <|endoftext|> What did you think of the weather patterns in The Day After Tomorrow? I feel like the cold weather was unrealistic, but worked as a great plot device. <|endoftext|> I felt like it was unrealistic as well, but used the necessary dramatics to drive the point home about how severe things could be. <|endoftext|> If you were in the New York City Library as well, which book would you save? I'd try and save a collection of Issac Asimov's short stories. <|endoftext|> I am a big fan of Edgar Allen Poes work so would try to save them if possible. <|endoftext|> It is unfortunate that climate change will not be as corrective as it appears in the movie. <|endoftext|> That is the unfortunate truth. Until more people are able to open their eyes and try to make a change, things are not going to get better. <|endoftext|> It is always the scientists who are right and not listened to in the movies that make me sad. I wish more scientists were viewed as national heroes. <|endoftext|> I couldn't possibly agree with that statement anymore than I do right now. Scientists present facts that people choose to ignore and it's very disheartening. <|endoftext|> If that movie were made again today, I imagine there would be a Fake News sub-plot to speed up humanities downfall. <|endoftext|> More than likely. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Hello, I am looking for a movie reccomendation <|endoftext|> Ok, sure! What is your favorite types of movies? Action, drama, comedy, horror, etc.? <|endoftext|> I prefer romantic comedies <|endoftext|> Ok, I think a great romantic comedy would be a classic called Clueless. It is about school aged girls and romances and has a lot of funny banter. <|endoftext|> I love that movie, but I have already seen it. Is there another movie from that time period that you would reccomend <|endoftext|> Sure! My Best Friend's Wedding is also a really funny movie from around that time period. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> I have not, I accept that reccomendation <|endoftext|> Awesome! <|endoftext|> Thank you <|endoftext|> You're welcome! <|endoftext|> Could you reccomend me a different movie too? <|endoftext|> Sure! Another movie from that time period is called When Harry Met Sally-- it's a classic. <|endoftext|> I accept that reccomendation Do you know about any musicals similar to grease? <|endoftext|> Yes, there is a musical called Hairspray, have you seen it? <|endoftext|> I have, do you have a different reccomendation <|endoftext|> Flashdance, Mama Mia, and Footloose are also similar to Grease. <|endoftext|> I have never seen flashdance, Ill check it out <|endoftext|> Great! I hope you enjoy it! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> You're welcome! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello there, would you like to watch a movie trailer? What are some of your favorite type of movies? <|endoftext|> I like all types. Comedies, science fiction, action. But nothing too scary <|endoftext|> I love comedies. The best way to smile is though laughter. Do you like older comedies or something that just came out? <|endoftext|> I would love to see a newer comedy. I believe Tiffany Haddish has a new(ish) movie out <|endoftext|> She is very funny. Here is the weird fact....we share the same birthday, Dec. 3. <|endoftext|> Oh wow. That is pretty cool. Have you seen her interview and heard her background? She was in the foster system for a while. I have watched Girls trip so many times already. <|endoftext|> She is such a solid leader for young girls to look up to. Did you know she is good friends with Arsenio Hall? <|endoftext|> I didn't but I love him too. I remembered that new movie she was in. It was called Like a Boss. Have you seen that one? <|endoftext|> Yes she was great in that. Did you know that she was the first black female to host Saturday Night Live? Would you like to see her newest movie trailer Bad Trip? <|endoftext|> I didn't know she was the first black female to host Saturday Night Live. I have never heard or Bad Trip, but if she is in it I definitely will. What is it about? <|endoftext|> It will be coming out later this year. It is about Two friends embark on a cross-country road trip where they prank people using hidden cameras. It is pretty funny. I do have one movie trailer to show you, have you seen Night School? Would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Sure, I'll see a trailer <|endoftext|> You like Kevin Hart? They are good in this movie together <|endoftext|> Yeah, I like him. He always cracks me up. Good combination <|endoftext|> Well in this comedy, a group of high school dropouts are forced to attend night school in hope that they'll pass the GED exam to finish high school. <|endoftext|> Sounds hysterical, I think I would like that movie <|endoftext|> Its really funny. Would you like to see the trailer? <|endoftext|> Yes, I would like to see that trailer. I need to laugh right now. <|endoftext|> You're old enough for a rated R movie aren't you? haha <|endoftext|> Sure am. Lol <|endoftext|> Good. Just cant be too careful now-a-days? Am I right? haha <|endoftext|> True that. I'm actually way older than I look. Such a blessing. Thanks for the recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello. How are you today? <|endoftext|> Hi! I am well. And you? <|endoftext|> Great! Have you seen any good movies lately? <|endoftext|> Yes! I saw Parasite and Jo Jo Rabbit - both excellen <|endoftext|> They were :) Do you like horror movies? <|endoftext|> I do not really - I find myself either too invested or not invested enough. Hard for me to enjoy them. Although I loved Midsommar <|endoftext|> I agree with you. They often have poor plots. What about superhero movies in the DC or Marvel universe? <|endoftext|> Yes - I have seen the majority of them. I like them <|endoftext|> You should check out the new black widow movie trailer! It's awesome she is finally getting her own movie. <|endoftext|> Intersting, yeah I may do that - I thought she was dead though <|endoftext|> She is, but her movie will delve into her backstory. It takes place years ago and really shows her story. <|endoftext|> Ok wow - yeah, I am into that. I will definitely check that trailer out <|endoftext|> I love her outfits in this <|endoftext|> This looks great - I love the backstory angle <|endoftext|> Yeah its unfortunate it was delayed because of the virus, but we have end game to hold us over <|endoftext|> Thanks again for the reco - I will likely see that when it comes out now <|endoftext|> Good! Have a nice day! <|endoftext|> Thanks you too! <|endoftext|> Thank you! <|endoftext|> Thanks again - I am looking forward to this now <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you look for a movie trailer! <|endoftext|> Hi! I'm looking for a uplifting movie and is pretty corny at times. Do you have any suggestions? <|endoftext|> Are you looking for a newer movie or do you not care how old it is? <|endoftext|> I don't mind if it's older. I actually seem to prefer old Rom-Coms such as the Wedding Date, Must Love Dogs, and Hallmark movies. I'm also a hug fan of Pride and Prejudice. I love movies that have handsome male characters that have terrible first impressions. <|endoftext|> I feel you on the handsome characters!! For a good Rom Com I enjoyed the movie Valentines Day. For something up lifting my favorite movie is Last Holiday with Queen Latifah. <|endoftext|> Can you tell me more about Last Holiday? I do like Christmas movies a lot! I think I saw Valentine's Day and wasn't a fan but I could be thinking of another movie as well. <|endoftext|> Of course! It is a romantic comedy-drama. The film stars Queen Latifah as Georgia, a humble store assistant who is told that she has a rare brain condition and only has a few weeks to live. She promptly decides to spend her last funds on a luxury holiday in Europe (like a last hurrah) and she falls in love too! <|endoftext|> The brain condition sounds really sad. Without spoiling the ending will I be crying at the end of the movie or smiling? <|endoftext|> You will be smiling at the end! I promise it is a comedy as well <|endoftext|> Okay! I'll take a change on it. Thank you so much for your help! <|endoftext|> You are very welcome :) <|endoftext|> Can you tell me more about the person she falls in love with? <|endoftext|> He is one of her co-workers who she flirts with, but doesn't realize he is into her! <|endoftext|> So is the trip she takes to Europe a business trip? Also does she have any family or friends that she has for support? <|endoftext|> It is not a business trip it is a trip she takes to go live her life and do all these things on her bucket list after she finds out about all the bad news (but i promise you it is a happy ending) she has 1-2 friends and her family isn't in the story line really. <|endoftext|> So her co-worker shows up to the resort she in by chance? <|endoftext|> He goes there with a purpose to deliver her certain news and I do not want to spoil the ending haha! <|endoftext|> That's okay! The main character in this movie. How would you describe her in three words? <|endoftext|> Brave, Smart, and humble <|endoftext|> Do you know where I would be able to find Last Holiday? Hulu? Netflix? Amazon? <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hey. What is the type of movie trailers your interested in? <|endoftext|> i like it  comedy movie.to u like <|endoftext|> Oh yeah. Me too. I love Jim Carey and Will ferrel. Who is your favorite comedy actor? <|endoftext|> Jackie Chan, <|endoftext|> Yes I like Rush Hour. Great Movie. Would you be interested in watching Step Brothers with Will Ferrel? Its hilarious. <|endoftext|> oh thanks what about movie <|endoftext|> It is extremely funny. The whole movie from start to end. It has a story about two guys forced to live together because their parents marry each other. The funny thing is they still live at home and are grown men. <|endoftext|> Off Spinal Tap guitar duty, Christopher Guest turns his mockumentarian eye toward a tamer topic: The high-stakes world of competitive dog shows. The ridiculous comedic talent in this ensemble won\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt fit in one paragraph (it barely fits in one film), but we\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll throw you a bone: Parker Posey, Eugene Levy, Michael McKean, Bob Balaban, Catherine O\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHara, John Michael Higgins, and Guest himself all dominate the show\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdand that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds high praise in a movie about adorable dogs. <|endoftext|> oh that seems interesting. Do you think that you would watch the movie Step Brothers? I think once you watch the trailer you will immediately put it on if you have time to watch a movie. <|endoftext|> yes i watching movie thanks for recommended. <|endoftext|> oh good Im glad you are going to watch it. <|endoftext|> thanks,what type movies you like and watch <|endoftext|> I am a big fan of horror movies or dramas. <|endoftext|> oh! do you like get out movies? <|endoftext|> What are those? <|endoftext|> get out in most popular movie in america <|endoftext|> oh. Not familiar with it. <|endoftext|> oh i recommend this movie you watch this movie <|endoftext|> Is it in theaters now or can I watch it at home? <|endoftext|> yes you watch this movie in your house,please watch movie <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, I am here to help you find a movie trailer that you would be interested in. <|endoftext|> Hello, nice to meet you, I am very interested in Tom Hanks movies... <|endoftext|> Yes of course, I am a big fan! What do you like Tom Hanks and his films? <|endoftext|> Honestly, I like that he is a very versatile actor, the fact that he can work in animated movies and realistic narratives is absolutely astounding to me! <|endoftext|> I agree completely! His work in movies so serious, such as Captain Philips, and animated children's films, such as the Toy Story movie, shows how versatile he can be. <|endoftext|> I really enjoy his films but I haven't seen them all! What are some of your other favorites? <|endoftext|> Some of my favorites are the Toy Story movies, Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, and Cast Away. Have you seen all of those? <|endoftext|> ooo yes Castaway is one of my all time favorites! WILSONNNN LOL!! But i've never seen Forrest Gump, is that about the shrimp company? <|endoftext|> Yes! Part of the movie does include his work with the shrimp company, known as Bubba Gump Shrimp. Would you like me to explain a little more about it to see if you would be interested? <|endoftext|> Awesome I love the restaurants! Is the movie a tearjerker like Philadelphia? Or is it light and happy like Toy Story? <|endoftext|> It has a little bit of both! Happy and funny moments but also some very serious and sad. I feel like this movie would really appeal to you! <|endoftext|> It sounds like a real rollercoaster ride! What exactly does the plot of the film entail? <|endoftext|> The movie is all about the life of our protagonist, Forrest Gump. It begins with him as a boy growing up in Alabama. Throughout the movie, you witness his incredible journey of success. I will not spoil it, but much of the story includes love, the Vietnam War, and fame. I really think you would love this movie! <|endoftext|> Oh Alabama...? In what year does the movie take place? Are there aspects of racism within the film? <|endoftext|> The movie begins with Forrest as a boy during the 1950's then takes you throughout his life until about 1980. There are aspects of racism within the film that do coincide with some of the negative views that took place during those times. The film absolutely does not agree with any of the negative views that some characters exemplify. <|endoftext|> For me that is a good thing, I enjoy learning about historical events regarding the strife between races, but from reading your synopsis of the movie, I truly believe I would enjoy this film and I appreciate your recommendation! I plan on watching tonight with a bottle of red wine and some buttered popcorn :) <|endoftext|> Oh my sounds like a good night! Maybe I will re-watch it with a bottle of cabernet sauvignon. Quarantine life has been tough, but movies are keeping me going. The movie will definitely give you some motivation to get through the tough times. <|endoftext|> Omg yes, I've been so bored during this quarantine, every good recommendation is worth it! Do you know if Forrest Gump is on netflix? <|endoftext|> It used to be on Netflix, although they took it off. I am sure you can find it online somewhere for a small fee! <|endoftext|> Okay definitely worth it! I will look into that now! Thanks again for the stellar movie recommendation! <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi, how are you today? <|endoftext|> Im good. How are you? <|endoftext|> I am good also.

Have a great day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello, how are you today? <|endoftext|> Going good buddy. What about you? <|endoftext|> Great!

Have you seen Bad Boys For Life? It's so good. I highly recommend it if you like action. <|endoftext|> Yeah . Planned to watch this weekend <|endoftext|> That's awesome, how about The Gentlemen? I highly recommend that one as well. It stars Matthew McConaughey and is an extremely sophisticated action movie. <|endoftext|> Thanks for the suggestion but i would like to see Bad Boys for Life in this weekend <|endoftext|> Okay sounds good, have you seen the trailer? <|endoftext|> Not yet <|endoftext|> You should watch it! It's really intriguing and will get you hyped up to see the film! <|endoftext|> Wow Is it . Will watch soon .

It'll keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time! <|endoftext|> thanks a lot buddy . Definitely will watch <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hi how are you <|endoftext|> I am well and You today? <|endoftext|> i am good, what kind of movie are you interested in seeing? <|endoftext|> I am interested in an adventure movie with lots of sound and action. <|endoftext|> i love watching those kind of movies too. <|endoftext|> I do not like a lot of nudity or profane language tho. <|endoftext|> I understand, maybe we find a good recommendation for you. <|endoftext|> Maybe a movie with a historical angle to it? <|endoftext|> oh ok. i will see what I can recommend for you. <|endoftext|> and maybe with some really good actors in it too? <|endoftext|> how about Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom <|endoftext|> Hmm, I have seen that one too many times. Have anything newer that just came out? <|endoftext|> let me check <|endoftext|> Ok I like Nascar too so maybe there is one about a car race? <|endoftext|> oh i have one let me recommend this movie for you <|endoftext|> I can't remember the name but I think its about ford and ferrari? <|endoftext|> yes that is the exact one i just selected, did you see the trailer? <|endoftext|> A little bit of it in passing, looked interesting. <|endoftext|> do you accept ford vs ferrari? that is the new movie that just came out. <|endoftext|> Ahhh yes. I guess I did remember the name. Yes I do accept your reccomendation. Thank you. <|endoftext|> thank you so much, have a great day. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> Hello! I am here to help you find a movie trailer to watch. <|endoftext|> I need to see a good horror movie - any recommendations? <|endoftext|> Do you want to watch a new one or one of the classics? <|endoftext|> the classics are usually better, but I would like to see something new that I havent seen <|endoftext|> Agreed. Do you have any favorites of the ones you have seen so I can see what is similar out there? <|endoftext|> I like psychological thrillers - I'm not too into slasher films. I liked the movie 'Us' <|endoftext|> If you are a big fan of horror movies you may have already seen it but \"Get Out\" was a great watch <|endoftext|> Oh yes - that was an awesome movie with a great twist. I think I'll watch it again. Thanks for recommending. <|endoftext|> Glad I could help. <|endoftext|> Great - I think we're done <|endoftext|> I agree. I will send the official recommendation to you <|endoftext|> Ok that would be great <|endoftext|> Ok! I have sent it to you for you to accept <|endoftext|> OK I'll accept it as soon as I receive <|endoftext|> Do you need any other movie recommendations while we wait? <|endoftext|> No that's all - thanks again. Done <|endoftext|> Perfect. Hope you enjoy! <|endoftext|> OK - I'm going to pop some popcorn later and watch it <|endoftext|> That sounds like the perfect plan <|endoftext|> Yes. I like watching movies that make you think and Get Out definitely makes you think. <|endoftext|>", "<|endoftext|> hello there what kind of movie are you looking for? <|endoftext|> I am looking for anything in the science fiction or humor genres. <|endoftext|> oh like a combination? <|endoftext|> That would be fine, or if it's only one, that's okay too. <|endoftext|> have you ever seen Galaxy Quest? it is a scifi comedy <|endoftext|> One of my favorites! Even Passengers had some humor. <|endoftext|> i have not seen that one. thats with jennifer lawrence isnt it <|endoftext|> Yes, and Chris Pratt. I am not overly interested in the actors though, just a good story. <|endoftext|> have you seen Evolution? thats a very good scifi comedy <|endoftext|> Shoot, I have not. But will check it out! <|endoftext|> it is from the maker of ghostbusters <|endoftext|> Love me some Ghostbusters.
